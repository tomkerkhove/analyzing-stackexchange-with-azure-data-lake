Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastEditorUserId="2751" LastEditDate="2016-10-06T19:02:17.430" LastActivityDate="2016-10-06T19:02:17.430" CommentCount="0" />

This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Chemistry: Cause of Bitter Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Basics: The Difference Between Arabica and Robusta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38" LastEditorUserId="2751" LastEditDate="2016-09-15T09:49:10.320" LastActivityDate="2016-09-15T09:49:10.320" CommentCount="0" />

Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt; the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich &quot;amazing coffee&quot; aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some beans continue to change for &lt;strong&gt;several days after roasting&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week.

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t know?!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="132" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T13:34:08.870" CommentCount="0" />

Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. &lt;em&gt;It is said to help improve&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;crema&lt;/strong&gt;. &#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat).

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xA;  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans.

This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;gooseneck kettle&lt;/a&gt; for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit Redux:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results.

Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickens.

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences by Region&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in coffee by Country&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Green Processing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Age of the Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acid Degradation over Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Level of Roast&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acidity VS Level of Roast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the&#xA;  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still&#xA;  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t&#xA;  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. &#xA;  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad&#xA;  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and&#xA;  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature&#xA;  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known&#xA;  or suspected carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Differences by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/&quot;&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" CommentCount="6" />

Read on! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp;amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Average Flavor Profile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water.

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is helpful: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="2751" LastEditDate="2016-10-10T11:21:54.137" LastActivityDate="2016-10-10T11:21:54.137" CommentCount="4" />

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.

You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voila! Provided you are pretty skilled at handling and measuring things, you have an accurate answer. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="132" LastEditorUserId="2751" LastEditDate="2016-09-24T18:24:55.973" LastActivityDate="2016-09-24T18:24:55.973" CommentCount="9" />

It is called ISSpresso and is the&#xA;  brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in&#xA;  collaboration with the Italian Space Agency&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard&#xA;  the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this&#xA;  comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at&#xA;  times working in the International Space Station, and today their&#xA;  espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza&#xA;  are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually&#xA;  bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space&#xA;  Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xA;  the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xA;  astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xA;  Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xA;  space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xA;  Italian espresso in orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its name is ISSpresso.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes its name from the International Space&#xA;  Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xA;  capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xA;  of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xA;  liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xA;  ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xA;  engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xA;  European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xA;  in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xA;  ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xA;  deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xA;  was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xA;  the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xA;  Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xA;  and activities to be carried out in the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments &lt;strong&gt;Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xA;  of Lavazza&lt;/strong&gt; — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xA;  space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xA;  the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xA;  Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xA;  time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xA;  just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xA;  overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xA;  indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xA;  International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xA;  project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xA;  division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xA;  and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xA;  nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xA;  astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xA;  thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xA;  systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xA;  Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xA;  high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xA;  with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xA;  challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xA;  Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xA;  In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xA;  the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xA;  important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xA;  espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xA;  especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xA;  home.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xA;  national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xA;  initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xA;  technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xA;  ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xA;  with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xA;  improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xA;  astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xA;  exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xA;  contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xA;  Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A coffee break in space.&lt;/strong&gt; A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xA;  currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xA;  functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xA;  Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xA;  launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xA;  whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xA;  café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xA;  a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xA;  chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xA;  missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xA;  very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xA;  be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xA;  or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xA;  also be rehydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail&#xA;  of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xA;  challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xA;  physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xA;  handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xA;  environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xA;  inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xA;  steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The&#xA;  machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there&#xA;  are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xA;  accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xA;  Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xA;  which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xA;  menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xA;  dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xA;  have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xA;  future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Just found images on The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastEditorUserId="31" LastEditDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" LastActivityDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" CommentCount="6" />

Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L?

One scoop of&#xA;beans weighs about &lt;strong&gt;12 grams&lt;/strong&gt; (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xA;and volume).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the &lt;strong&gt;120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xA;exercise. &lt;em&gt;The strongest &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xA;that scoop of beans will have &lt;strong&gt;no more than&lt;/strong&gt; 120mg caffeine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How strong is my cup?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xA;considered optimal&lt;/a&gt; whereas &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xA;solids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz&lt;/a&gt;. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of &quot;optimal&quot; brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it &quot;too weak&quot; and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains &lt;strong&gt;around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is around &lt;strong&gt;0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bonus corollary/sanity check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;7g of ground&#xA;coffee&lt;/a&gt; maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the &lt;strong&gt;64mg/shot&lt;/strong&gt; reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the USDA and others&lt;/a&gt; also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastEditorUserId="86" LastEditDate="2016-09-06T21:55:03.650" LastActivityDate="2016-09-06T21:55:03.650" CommentCount="0" />

Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day.

I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty.

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts.

Basically the way it works is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a load of volunteers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track them over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, only for &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.).

The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;).

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.

I have tried adding table salt to the coffee first, then adding the coffee to the soya milk, and it seems to help (a little, sometimes; YMMV). &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/28179/25286&quot;&gt;Another Cooking.SE question&lt;/a&gt; also suggests waiting for coffee to cool. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The linked TheKitchn article (linked from the aforementioned previous question and @PythonMaster's answer) suggests that cooling the coffee, or pouring coffee &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the soya milk (rather than the other way around) helps via similar mechanisms. In my experience in messing with this, &lt;strong&gt;I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). &lt;strong&gt;It absolutely depends on the type of coffee&lt;/strong&gt;, also, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;different coffees will have different degrees of acidity&lt;/a&gt;.

In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO, I have found &lt;em&gt;the brand&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that &lt;strong&gt;soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  My only guesses are that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;xanthan gum&lt;/a&gt;) interfere with the coagulation, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination).

Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. &lt;strong&gt;The sooner you drink it the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.&lt;/strong&gt; You might also look into cold brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Black Bear Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" CommentCount="2" />

No. &#xA;What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Please just save me from exogenous variables&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh... you should have just said so.... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&#xA;C is Country &#xA;P is Preparation &#xA;G is Green Processing&#xA;and the bar plot shows the distribution of acidity&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment if you'd like me to add a variable or further analysis to this answer! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2016-01-28T22:53:07.130" CommentCount="6" />

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262&quot;&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes!

So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning...

That being said I also have an Aeropress I use 2 or 3 times a week to make coffee (I use a drip machine or clever dripper the rest of the time).  What I have found is that any coffee I buy/roast that ISN'T recommended as a SO espresso tastes poor to me when brewed with my Aeropress.  I have solved this issue for myself by no longer buying beans that aren't recommended as a SO espresso.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My untested hypothesis from this is that most coffees that would not do well as espresso will also not do well as aeropresso.  While the resulting coffee from an Aeropress is not espresso, the brew methods share enough in common and the results are similar enough (not the same, but similar) that they have (my opinion) quite a bit in common with what beans do well when brewed in that manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single origin versus blended don't mean anything out of the context of how they taste.  It's possible to have a poorly grown and processed single origin that won't be great no matter how it's brewed, but it's still single origin.  It's also possible to find blends that are done so for a variety of bad reasons (to produce a consistent, but not great taste, to reduce costs, etc) or blends that are done for the right reasons (to get a specific taste profile that may not be possible with any single origin, but IS great).  There are great and less than great single origin coffees.  There are also great and less than great blends.  I thing that some folks have biases against blends because in the past they were most often done for cost or consistency reasons and not necessarily for the best flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I would likely recommend anything that should be good for espresso (single origin or blend) and high quality as a good candidate for Aeropress brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="76" LastEditDate="2017-03-05T23:03:06.367" LastActivityDate="2017-03-05T23:03:06.367" CommentCount="0" />

Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;amp;t=833&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where all the information of this section came from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that provided the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html&quot;&gt;the use of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; saucers&lt;/a&gt; for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm&quot;&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html&quot;&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;.

It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This pretty much explains this abnormal Swedish tradition.

But that&#xA;  changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last&#xA;  10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the&#xA;  understanding of variability.

So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's answer your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T00:36:52.153" CommentCount="2" />

For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure&quot;&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262&quot;&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;it seems that AeroPress can create crema&lt;/a&gt; at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maybe.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;One four-subject test&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;em&gt;higher marks&lt;/em&gt; to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; agrees. Another test disagreed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;It doesn't matter.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), &lt;strong&gt;what difference does it make if it's &lt;em&gt;&quot;real&quot;&lt;/em&gt; espresso or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso?

Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262&quot;&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time&quot;&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T22:03:44.680" CommentCount="9" />

This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for &quot;polishing&quot;, but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Knocking&quot; is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;North, South, West, East&quot; topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few articles on different takes on tamping: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualcoffee.com/jun/perfect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I Need Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-07-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" LastActivityDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" CommentCount="0" />

So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;&quot;100% fresh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present.

There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_Shock&quot;&gt;bar soaps, like this one&lt;/a&gt;, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To keep this on-topic...&quot; As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are &quot;0.001% and 0.005%.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean&quot;&gt;Coffee beans themselves&lt;/a&gt; have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the &quot;bioavailability&quot; of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper.

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage).

Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html&quot;&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="271" LastActivityDate="2015-03-07T00:21:07.180" CommentCount="2" />

You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.&#xA;Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  &lt;em&gt;burned&lt;/em&gt;, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. &#xA;Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all.

I recommend using cold or lukewarm water as this will allow you rub at the (layers of) stain without risk of pain from hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The build-up is largely from water soluble compounds in the coffee, and because the brewing process creates a concentration of these in hot water, as the brew cools these tend to come out of solution.  There will also be tiny particles of ground coffee, small enough to make their way through the filter/basket that holds the original coffee grounds, and these particles act to promote the staining/sedimentation, esp. at the bottom of your carafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've already seen the first evidence of success when the rinse water came out almost as dark as the brewed coffee the carafe normally holds.

In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; interesting!). With just about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example of drip versus espresso, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on caffeine&lt;/a&gt; (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has &lt;em&gt;slightly more&lt;/em&gt; caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (&quot;standard dose&quot;, from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;citation listed at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, those are listed as &lt;em&gt;grams&lt;/em&gt;, which means that water could dissolve &lt;em&gt;tens to hundreds of times&lt;/em&gt; as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;; also keep in mind that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262&quot;&gt;lethal dose of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time&lt;/a&gt;, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; caffeine content coffee; the point being that the &quot;other stuff&quot; (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; short indeed) you'll get most of the &quot;other stuff&quot; but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor&lt;/a&gt;; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2015-03-21T20:52:14.513" CommentCount="3" />

As for the health benefits, almond milk has good proteins, calcium and Vitamin D, low sugar as long it is unsweetened. It is rather hard to  make latte art or steam as well for a perfect cup.

It compliments coffee very well and is very delicious when put in coffee. It creates a great foam and is easier to have be steamed. It has been criticized though for many different reasons. If you are allergic to diary, never use soy milk or any milk at all really. Soy milk can match the consistency and texture of a good cup of coffee. Soy milk is a forgiving milk that goes with many types of coffee.

It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting the two types of cones:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the &quot;wells&quot; from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow &quot;seals&quot; itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for &quot;why&quot; this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the &quot;seal&quot; and permits the coffee to drain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar &quot;ridge&quot; that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little &quot;pleats&quot; in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that this &quot;pooling&quot; happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the &quot;sealing,&quot; but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:32:31.893" LastActivityDate="2015-03-23T15:35:37.900" CommentCount="0" />

Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another take would be to look at the &quot;science&quot; of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This CoffeeGeek article&lt;/a&gt; discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-03-23T19:35:36.037" CommentCount="0" />

Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.

These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.&lt;/strong&gt; Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew.

You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started roasting, I was &quot;lucky&quot; enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the &quot;cracks&quot; associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the &quot;cracks&quot; are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-03-07T00:18:23.243" LastActivityDate="2016-03-07T00:18:23.243" CommentCount="0" />

I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.

An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance.

Espresso is a very specific brewing method that produces a very specific type of coffee.  Trying to mimic that flavor profile with other brew methods will generally fall short.  Using more coffee for stronger flavor is one option, but it ends up not being cost effective in the long run.  More extraction is an option, but over extracted coffee often has a flavor profile associated with it that isn't desirable as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closest you can get (in my opinion) on a budget is probably an Aeropress.  It is fairly inexpensive and makes a very strong cup of coffee using a reasonable amount of grounds that isn't espresso, but also isn't over extracted.  The downside is that it's difficult to generate crema with such a brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might be forced to figure out which aspects of the long black you like, then come up with a brew method that gets you close on those aspects, but is probably missing others that make up the true long black.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-04-08T21:35:57.763" CommentCount="0" />

The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="443" LastActivityDate="2015-04-15T19:08:46.567" CommentCount="2" />

To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)

I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did all this over a six-week period.

While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="676" LastActivityDate="2015-04-17T19:28:48.770" CommentCount="1" />

If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests &lt;strong&gt;you might want to change other parameters of your brewing&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean&quot;&gt;this Q/A for what I mean by extraction&lt;/a&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could &lt;strong&gt;try this experimentally&lt;/strong&gt; also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way.

Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.

This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or so /that/ excuse goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive.

What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Roast&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it &lt;em&gt;just at&lt;/em&gt; the second 'crack'.

In fact, illy (red) comes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't raise your expectations &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; high, it's not really &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much better than any other very high quality Arabica.

Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, however, you are using a single (7g) portafilter basket then the 58mm tamper would probably be too wide to compress the grounds evenly as it may not go far enough down in the portafilter basket to tamp it at all.

You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the pitcher becomes &lt;em&gt;just less&lt;/em&gt; than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it.

No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top. Not surprisingly, you'll get very uneven extraction from these different particles, no matter what the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you grind long enough to decimate all the beans, you'll find a lot of fine coffee dust and sediment in your cup. Too short a grind, and you get a lot of beans and bean pieces that can't present enough extractable surface area to the hot water, leading to a thin, weak cup. Waste of coffee, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a &lt;em&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/em&gt; grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans move through &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;.

This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.

It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it.

If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs).

The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="869" LastActivityDate="2015-05-30T11:16:42.760" CommentCount="0" />

Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy.

Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap).

Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T00:34:16.983" CommentCount="0" />

You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T23:00:34.080" CommentCount="0" />

Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot.

Starting from the top...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste?&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a &quot;dried fruit&quot; taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt; (see this question/answers)&lt;/a&gt;.

Some coffee shops sell the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt; I've only seen &lt;em&gt;dried&lt;/em&gt; coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps &quot;fresh&quot; coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability?&lt;/strong&gt; Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the &quot;husks&quot;) -- here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;one example from Verve&lt;/a&gt;.

Blast out all the milk and &quot;wetness&quot; from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with &quot;bumping&quot; so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*especially &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calibrating&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frob&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png&quot; alt=&quot;frob quote from Hackers&amp;#39; Dictionary&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Frob. In the &lt;em&gt;frob&lt;/em&gt; pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't &lt;em&gt;aimless&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twiddle. In the &lt;em&gt;twiddle&lt;/em&gt; pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tweak. In the &lt;em&gt;tweak&lt;/em&gt; pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The controls we have available are the &lt;strong&gt;grind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;water quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop &lt;em&gt;just before&lt;/em&gt; the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on-the-fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same three adjustments, &lt;strong&gt;frob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, apply also to dynamic adjustments. &lt;strong&gt;Frob&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;coarsest&lt;/em&gt; control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;medium-grain&lt;/em&gt; control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. &lt;strong&gt;Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;finest&lt;/em&gt; control is the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with more &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little finer so you can achieve the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with less &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;. (Volume is constant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Appendix: The &quot;David Schomer&quot; method or &quot;ritual&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I remember from the amazing book, &lt;em&gt;Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques&lt;/em&gt; by David Schomer.

You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl...

Just between the ribs there are two circles, one on your side and one a few inches away on the other side. With a towel, wipe any crusty stuff from the edges of the two circles. These are the two halves which come together to form the brewing chamber, the &lt;em&gt;crucible&lt;/em&gt; of the alchemy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to treat your machine (maybe it's the machine's birthday), give it another pill before bringing it back up. Blast out the steam till it's nice and dry. Scrape and remove &lt;em&gt;all the milk residue&lt;/em&gt; until its just shiny shiny metal. Bottle-brush the steam tube.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sbuxpartners/comments/4jm0e4/best_practices_for_steamwand_cleaning/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Deep-cleaning the steam wands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then give its buddy some love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calibrating.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print &quot;adjust grind coarser&quot; or &quot;adjust grind finer&quot; on the screen. So, the machine only &quot;sees&quot; a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) &quot;too much inconsistency&quot;. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the numbers are &quot;too inconsistent&quot; (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks &lt;em&gt;coarser&lt;/em&gt; than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to &lt;em&gt;caking&lt;/em&gt; in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual &quot;death-spiral&quot; of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's acting &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt;, you may need to go &lt;em&gt;more-than-a-few&lt;/em&gt; clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official &quot;10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change&quot; that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How to know if you've gone coarse enough&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that &lt;em&gt;didn't &quot;catch&quot;&lt;/em&gt; on the old machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Run of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always, always, always, calibrate from the &lt;em&gt;coarse&lt;/em&gt; side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on the fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I posted this idea some years ago in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjoshua.ryan/posts/229630143825012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.&#xA;   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber is&#xA;   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulate&#xA;   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,&#xA;   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.&#xA;   You can:&#xA;   Before the first shot, click it finer.&#xA;   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.&#xA;   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser.

In moderation, sugar is a critical part of our diet. If you are combining it with two doughnuts and two further teaspoons of sugar in the coffee (for example) then it could potentially lead to the same insulin cycle that causes weight gain in people who eat too much sugar.

When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is &quot;clogged&quot; in this way.

If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more &quot;watery&quot; shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article from Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

You would want to make sure that you don't try to compensate for your days off by going on a binge and placing yourself directly under the espresso maker until you've had 3 days worth! In fact, that could make the problem worse because the difference between your &quot;on days&quot; and off days would be so much greater you might await those days the same way a junkie looks forward to their next hit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;droog has the right idea. Try to see if there are ways to rotate in other substitutes for coffee. Maybe you enjoy the hot drink, or you look forward to the short break it takes to prepare it. Regardless, people just don't go well with negative feedback. If you feel as if you are deeply depriving yourself, then change your approach. The way to be successful is to find a way that cuts down your caffeine intake while also not feeling as if you have lost something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1031" LastEditorUserId="1031" LastEditDate="2015-07-15T19:34:10.380" LastActivityDate="2015-07-15T19:34:10.380" CommentCount="3" />

Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. &lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else tried it?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any drawbacks to this method?

All are &quot;natural&quot; brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Chemex filter page&lt;/a&gt; states that they are &quot;20-30% heavier&quot; than other filters and removes finer sediment and &quot;undesirable oils and fats&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Melitta brand filters&lt;/a&gt; have claimed &quot;flavor enhancing perforations.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown (&quot;natural&quot;) style seems to be called &quot;Misarashi&quot; for reasons I don't understand.

I prefer your &quot;slower&quot; pour method over your friend's... read on for why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer story:&#xA;Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agree that water for pour-over should be &lt;strong&gt;just off the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but exact temperature is both difficult to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of &lt;strong&gt;93-97°C / 200-207°F&lt;/strong&gt;. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the &quot;right stuff&quot; from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an &quot;off&quot; taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.&lt;/em&gt; It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of pouring the water.&lt;/strong&gt; This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final &quot;drainage&quot; and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. &lt;strong&gt;I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; at a steady rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinsing your filter&lt;/a&gt;, and see more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom&quot;&gt;wetting the grounds for coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2015-07-23T05:06:03.330" CommentCount="4" />

And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;strong&gt;mass-market coffee like this might &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from AeroPress treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Robusta produces &lt;strong&gt;more crema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in espresso, and might be a way to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;more crema from AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;. Robusta also has slightly &lt;strong&gt;more caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt;, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, &lt;strong&gt;you might reduce a bit of the bitterness&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be a few problems, though.&lt;/strong&gt; First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like &lt;strong&gt;Maxwell House is rather course&lt;/strong&gt; for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bunn&lt;/a&gt;). Second, if there are other &quot;stuff&quot; in the coffee (e.g., &quot;Folgers Crystals&quot; or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But give it a try!

If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this.

I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their &quot;espresso&quot; blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and &quot;highest end products&quot; are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.

Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark.

To start, let's explain the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing_process&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso is the key to this whole discussion. Each of the four beverages you referenced is (or contains) Espresso. Espresso is a method of brewing coffee, by which pressurized water is passed through a compacted &quot;puck&quot; of fine grounds. In a traditional espresso shot, roughly 0.25 oz of grounds are used to create about 0.85 oz of Espresso. Caffeine levels vary depending on the coffee beans, but as a mainstream reference, Espresso made by Starbucks contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;approximately 75mg&lt;/a&gt; (they use slightly different measurements, however).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ristretto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ristretto is a form of Espresso in which &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; water is used. So you take the same puck of 0.25 oz of finely ground coffee, but instead of making 0.9 oz of Espresso, you make a &lt;em&gt;more concentrated&lt;/em&gt; 0.5 oz (or so). Because the strongest Espresso is the first to be brewed, this is &lt;strong&gt;the most concentrated form of espresso&lt;/strong&gt;, and as such has the most caffeine &lt;em&gt;per ounce&lt;/em&gt; of any drink on this list. That said, one shot of Ristretto is is less caffeinated than one shot of Espresso simply because there's less of it. As such, if measuring by the amount of caffeine per shot, this is the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; caffeinated drink on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lungo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lungo is the exact opposite of Ristretto. Instead of being an Espresso made with less water, it's an Espresso made with &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the water. As such, a single shot of Lungo has &lt;strong&gt;the most overall caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; of any drink on this list, but is less concentrated than either standard Espresso or Ristretto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Americano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is Espresso with water in it. No, really. A solo Americano has the exact same amount of caffeine as a solo Espresso, however it is watered down, and as such is the least concentrated drink on this list. You could hypothetically make an Americano from Ristretto or Lungo shots instead of standard Espresso, and in doing so make it less or more caffeinated (respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all are made with the same number of shots, the most caffeinated drinks &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lungo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Espresso / Americano (tied)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ristretto&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most caffeinated drinks &lt;em&gt;per oz&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ristretto&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Espresso&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lungo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Americano&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1231" LastActivityDate="2015-08-26T17:38:28.457" CommentCount="0" />

It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who&#xA;  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints&#xA;  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia on &quot;Small Beer&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a lightly alcoholic beverage)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://gladwell.com/java-man/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Malcom Gladwell&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1244" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-12T07:34:00.963" LastActivityDate="2015-08-29T10:28:29.973" CommentCount="0" />

Percolator coffee relies on gravity to move water that's generally boiling (100 degrees) through coffee. The water temperature does make a significant difference because it is possible to burn coffee with water - which is one of the reasons that to many espresso drinkers filter coffee tastes burnt. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind makes a significant difference as well, Espresso coffee is generally ground finer than drip filter coffee which makes for a more intense taste for the volume of liquid. As per Chris' post, roast and been quality makes a difference - although I'd slightly disagree with Chris and say that it's more than a hindrance. The same bean ground for espresso and produced by an espresso machine and then ground for and produced by a drip filter will taste much different - and he's right in saying that it will highlight a really bad bean. It is also part of the skill of good baristas though that they know how to grind and extract almost any bean to get the best out of it, I know baristas who adjust for humidity though too so how far you can go is a guess for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1305" LastActivityDate="2015-09-11T03:54:26.160" CommentCount="0" />

Also, green beans store better for longer time (e.g., freezing) so you can capture a particularly good &quot;year&quot; or crop of beans for a longer period of time. Even whole, unprocessed cherries might be an interesting notion. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skins and pulp.&lt;/strong&gt; People make beverages out of the (usually discarded) fruit skin and pulp, called &lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;qishr&lt;/em&gt;, or other names.

In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and&#xA;  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom&#xA;  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%&#xA;  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional&#xA;  impairment was 13%. Typically, onset of symptoms occurred 12–24 h&#xA;  after abstinence, with peak intensity at 20–51 h, and for a duration&#xA;  of 2–9 days. In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms&#xA;  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from &lt;strong&gt;doses as low&#xA;  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;.

I had the opposite issue but similar techniques might help you. I looked at the system as having 3 basic variables: temperature, airflow, and volume of beans. Alter any one and you can achieve a different result. In my case I was unable to achieve high enough temps with my Air Crazy; particularly in cold weather since I roast outside. This is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Change the thermostat. I did it to increase temps but this is how I'd achieve a lower temp also. I switched the thermostat on my Air Crazy popper to increase the temp at which the element was turned off. If you pull it apart there is likely a thermostat on the chamber that opens the element circuit.  It should be marked in some way to indicate it's properties. Mine was riveted on. IIRC I bought a higher temp thermostat and also spaced it off the chamber a little. I used small stainless machine screws/nuts to reattach. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's going to have 120v passing through it so make certain it is secure and the terminals are not contacting/energizing any other component like the actual roasting cup or popper case.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have thermostat of some type in your element circuit (you almost certainly do) they are readily available online in a large range of temps. I believe mine opens at 210C now; I think it was 180c when I bought it. 210C is pretty hot and the whole popper gets rather hot but it works for me. You need one that resets, not a single use piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008X0Y14A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are what I used as I have 2 in my desk drawer right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case if you need to reduce the temps you may try thermal compound for CPU fans or a similar substance to increase conductivity and contact area at the thermostat, possibly turning off the element at a lower temp.  If not they clean up easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2)I altered the airflow also by closing some of the vents on the popping chamber, I've forgotten if I did this prior to upping the temps.  Same amount of air through fewer louvers resulted in higher velocities. Mine has louvers on the sides creating a swirling airflow to agitate the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3)I added mass to the bottom of the popping chamber in an attempt to stabilize the overall temps. A few layers of heavy foil tape were enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4)I attached screens (actual window screen pieces) to intakes on bottom of it to stop the chaff from entering and burning on the element. I credit this for the 2 yr of usage I've gotten from this popper. Other elements have burnt open much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) I played with volume of beans to find max I could do without having uneven results. Too much and airflow was insufficient, too few beans seemed to greatly affect the quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In current practice I usually need to manually shake the popper every 20 sec or so up to first crack, from there the dried beans circulate well. I like very dark roasts so I also often restrict airflow somewhat later in the process by pressing the popper into a thick towel.  It is the easiest way I know to alter airflow (and thus temperature) on the fly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was several years ago so memory may be inaccurate. I'm not currently with the popper but can get it if you want more info or pics.

One problem you might encounter is the &lt;em&gt;rather short infusion time&lt;/em&gt; commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to &lt;strong&gt;steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; More thoughts based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2430/262&quot;&gt;a later question&lt;/a&gt;: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kinfolk.com/recipe-cardamom-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/try-this-cardamom-coffee-180331&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (somewhat arbitrary top search hits).

However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.

If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can also be the bean, some roasts just &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/&quot;&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us&quot;&gt;Illy&lt;/a&gt; produce a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2015-09-29T07:28:46.283" CommentCount="4" />

Though cessation of regular use may result in symptoms such as headache and lethargy, these are easily and reliably reversed by ingestion of caffeine. Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current article on point in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts#1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; says that caffeine addiction is a myth, with &quot;some truth to it,&quot; concluding: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by &quot;addictive.&quot; Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence.

If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans.

Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extraction versus Time graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a good starting place is a 1:16 ratio, meaning 1 parts coffee to 16 parts water.

So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted.

It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--&quot;&gt;article.&lt;/a&gt; Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &amp;lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but &#xA;a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology,&lt;/em&gt; Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al.

It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1068" LastEditorUserId="1068" LastEditDate="2015-11-22T14:01:04.700" LastActivityDate="2015-11-22T14:01:04.700" CommentCount="1" />

They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nestle press release found at &lt;em&gt;www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/good-news-milk-cream-coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whichever line of research you choose to follow, it may not really impact your health over much anyway.

In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo&quot;&gt;lungo&lt;/a&gt;. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a &lt;em&gt;darker roast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try beans from a &lt;em&gt;different region&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick beans further off of the roast.&lt;/strong&gt; This is really only for completeness, but beans that were &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out.

The reason why instant coffee may have &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; caffeine than your typical brewed coffee is that it's usually &lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt; coffee.

You may be getting more solids in your cup of coffee with a french press (and it's hard to compare french press vs instant coffee by weight since instant is so processed).

Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot&lt;/strong&gt;. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. &lt;strong&gt;The flame being completely under and within the base is best.&lt;/strong&gt; It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel!

With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snobbery.

The thermal capacity must be high. It's hard to explain this on text. The cezve must be a bit sturdy. This is all I can say. The copper ones aren't generally sturdy. A bit thicker stainless steel ones are nicer for that. So, you can brew your coffee fast and also homogeneously distribute the heat. This is quite important when preparing your coffee in your own hands. The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The bottom must be a bit larger than the top.

Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.

That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cezve&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hand grinder&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hand grinder setting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fincan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Floating Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fire setting for Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Greasy sunk Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start stirring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stir the Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Foam of Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stir the Turkish coffee for first heating&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PeJ9M.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PeJ9M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The first heating point of Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5sqx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5sqx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Filled Turkish coffee fincans after first heating&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wpxrv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wpxrv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heating and stirring Turkish coffee for the second time&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKdNO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKdNO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Turkish coffee in fincans after second heating is done&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marbled foam of Turkish coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5x26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5x26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nearly boiling Turkish coffee in cezve&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShfJM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShfJM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Turkish coffee in fincan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, there shouldn't be any grounds remain in cezve.

So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp;amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?&#xA;Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular &#xA;beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods. E.g., &quot;beans good for aeropress will often be good for Turkish&quot;, or &quot;Turkish is the opposite of espresso&quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know when I like the coffee I made, so there are some favourites to my taste.

But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The coffee beans &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&amp;#39;den_gelir-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last words:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It exists!&lt;/a&gt;) before drinking.

I can't find it locally though :(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some science (sorry I lost all the links...): Espresso is defined by making hot water run through tamped ground coffee at around 9 bar pressure. Only then the oils are extracted. The process of extraction generates the crema.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for aeropress, in order to generate 9 bars, the math tells that you have to press it with 294kg (plus some extra bit that I don't know how to calculate...). Let's call it 300. So you need a lever to do that. And you have to make the lever's math work out because you need as close to 9 bar as possible. More or less will not make an espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, what I personally do is this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Make REAL Espresso With a $20 Aeropress! - Tutorial (YouTube).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is NOT &quot;real&quot; espresso, but I think it's the closest thing you can. And definitely the best method for aeropress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last thing: if you don't use a lever, which could actually generate crema (real espresso); don't worry about whether foam is created. It doesn't make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No... this is the last thing: With said, preferred method, timing doesn't matter.

Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like &quot;Cloud&quot; is for computing.  &quot;Cloud&quot; is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not &quot;branded&quot; by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of &quot;as is&quot;.

Coffee beans are more resistant than ground coffee though, as that decays in a couple of hours. Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the compounds improve, other does not.

Every new batch of coffee beans you'll need to run a couple of shots, and perhaps make big changes, to re-calibrate to the nature of the new beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factors that play into this equation include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how much coffee you put into the basket (more coffee requires a coarser grind)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how hard you tamped it (packing it harder invites a coarser grind)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how fresh the beans are (as they age they dry out, inviting a finer grind as they age)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how oily or dry the beans appear to be ('shiny' roasts tend to invite a coarser grind than ones where the surface of the beans appears light and dry)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;humidity (dry air helps the grinder get a fine grind, so dry air invites a coarser grinder setting, humid air invites a finer setting on the grinder)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all assumes there is water in the tank and the filter is clean and clear of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="898" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T07:48:32.917" CommentCount="1" />

A good coffee-to-water ratio&#xA;  is between 60-70 grams of coffee per liter of water (a mass ratio&#xA;  between 1:16 and 1:14). Decide how much brewed coffee you want to make&#xA;  and weigh out the right amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. With French press, you're good to pour your water right off the boil unless&#xA;  you've got an insulated (or double-walled) press, in which case you&#xA;  should wait about 30 seconds off of boil. If you're brewing&#xA;  dark-roasted coffee or decaf, it's better with water about 10 to 15°F&#xA;  lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your clock and add your water. Some people like to add a little water, stir, and add the rest. It really doesn't matter. The&#xA;  important part is what you do after you add the water. If you were to&#xA;  just sit back and wait out your brew time now, you'd have an&#xA;  under-extracted brew, because the release of CO2 gas will cause your&#xA;  grounds to rise up and float on top of your water. Remember that first&#xA;  phase &quot;Wetting?&quot; Well, if you don't have good wetting, you don't have&#xA;  much of anything that follows, so you should give your coffee and&#xA;  water mix a gentle but thorough stir at about 30 to 45 seconds in.&#xA;  You'll know you're good to put the lid on and move on to the next step&#xA;  when most of the coffee has sunk and isn't floating anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be very different from what you've heard before, but bear with me: shoot for a target brew time between &lt;strong&gt;6 and 8 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;What?&#xA;  I thought it was 3 to 4 minutes!&quot; you might say. You can brew in 3 to&#xA;  4 minutes if you want, but to get good flavor results, you'd be&#xA;  grinding a lot finer, and you're not getting the most out of the&#xA;  unique qualities of the French press. Give 6 to 8 minutes a try with&#xA;  the coarse grind, and see if you can dial that in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're ready to stop your brewing, it's time to plunge. So as I've mentioned, French press is a nice, slow, gentle brew. One great&#xA;  way to ruin that niceness would be to violently agitate your coffee&#xA;  grounds, accelerating extraction right at the end when your coffee has&#xA;  already given up the good stuff and the bitter and astringent negative&#xA;  flavors are in danger of taking over. Plunge gently. If you feel the&#xA;  plunger start to get tight, back it up an inch or two and resume&#xA;  plunging. Once you get to the bottom, you're done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've plunged your bed down nice and tight, there isn't a lot of brewing that will happen from this point on, but it's still ideal&#xA;  to pour off your entire beverage right after plunging to truly stop&#xA;  the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2094" LastActivityDate="2016-02-12T17:04:19.430" CommentCount="0" />

In people with&#xA;  hypertension, coffee consumption does transiently raise their blood&#xA;  pressure–although for no more than several hours–but no correlation&#xA;  has been found between coffee drinking and long-term increases in&#xA;  blood pressure or the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients&#xA;  with pre-existing hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Caffeine affects every person differently, so if you experience any&#xA;  negative side effects, consider cutting your coffee consumption&#xA;  accordingly. It takes about six hours for the effects of caffeine to&#xA;  wear off, so limit coffee drinking to early in the day, or switch to&#xA;  decaf, which only contains about 2 to 12 mg of caffeine per eight&#xA;  ounces. Always taper your coffee consumption gradually. Avoid quitting&#xA;  coffee cold turkey; doing so can lead to caffeine withdrawal symptoms&#xA;  that may include severe headache, muscle aches and fatigue which can&#xA;  last for days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Keep it Healthy&lt;/strong&gt;  Skip the fat-filled, sugar-laden coffeehouse beverages and order a basic black coffee.

In brewing; water temperature, length of contact with the grinds, and fineness of ground are the main factors you can control to keep bitterness to a minimum.  Here are a few explanations that might help:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotter water will dissolve all the compounds more quickly, including the bitter ones.  Make sure your water is &quot;off the boil&quot;, meaning somewhere between 195-205F.  This will mean the bitter notes will dissolve into the brew more slowly.  This is good.  Along these lines, one thing I've discovered is that using less water means the grounds will cool off the water more and they can steep for longer without producing bitterness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finer ground means more of the bitter compounds are in direct contact with the water so a slightly more coarse grind can reduce bitterness as well, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer hot water is in contact with the grounds, the more the bitterness will come out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question directly, just splitting your batch won't help without one of these modifications.  Without seeing your method directly I would offer these suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take care with your water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider only pouring a portion of the water over the grounds, like maybe half, to two thirds, then just pouring the rest of the water into the concentrated coffee.

Though admittedly certain brands are less likely to split, especially if steamed, frothed, emulsified etc. as in for certain drinks like latte.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker-roast coffees are more common (&quot;popular&quot;) &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; at mass-market chains, so I think that can also explain some of the prevalence of dark roasts for soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for taste, fat content and sugar content vary greatly for soy milk, even when discounting other additives like vanilla or other flavourings... so go for an unsweetened, un-flavoured brand. For my preference, the nuttier taste of soy milk is a good complement for Indonesian or other southeast-Asian coffees, which can be earthy, nutty, toasty, and take to darker-roasting well.

Brazil has some regions in which the harvest can be performed by machines, and others where this does not work so well.

Given how large the country is, that's not exactly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you see a coffee marketed as being from Brazil, this is most likely to distinguish the coffee from the cheaper brands that mix all kinds of coffee from different parts of the world.

When&#xA;  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the&#xA;  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which&#xA;  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast&#xA;  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to&#xA;  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from&#xA;  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we&#xA;  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk&#xA;  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:&#xA;  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff&#xA;  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other&#xA;  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We&#xA;  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means&#xA;  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed&#xA;  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and&#xA;  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process&#xA;  to see where we can make improvements.

You would need a thermometer to accurately gauge the temperature, but at the very least make sure the water is well off the boil before you add it.  Second, don't leave the water on the grounds for too long.  The longer the water is brewing, the more bitter notes will be extracted.  Finally, a bit coarser grind might also help.  The usual recommendation is for something slightly finer than what you would use for drip brew.  You might try something slightly more coarse and see how that goes.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If none of that works, of course you could always switch methods.

The brewing process is about extraction. The balance of sweet/bitter/tannin/acid/flavors can be affected by your brew process. I find that acids and fruit go hand in hand, and so the perception of the fruit flavors can be enhanced by acids. Doing a cold brew I find is amazing for dark roasts, because it subdues the acids, and the dark chocolate/woody flavors don't work as well with a lot of acids in my opinion. I believe an espresso brings out maximum acidity/brightness for any given coffee, and you get a lot of citrus notes, but that might be too bright to taste the sweet flavors you're looking for. That means you want something in the middle just erring on the side of bright. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this: find a Panama (or other central/south American origin) dry-processed (aka &quot;natural&quot;) and brew it with gentle pressure for sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dry-processed/Natural coffees are dried out with fruit flesh on before its removal, which allows the sweetness and flavor of cascara fruit seep into the beans.

Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional &quot;home-grown&quot; coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vietnamese-coffee.com/vietnamese_coffee_about.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here you will find more information&lt;/a&gt; on how the technique for the beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope helps answer your question&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2118" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:33:37.573" LastActivityDate="2016-03-16T15:49:00.393" CommentCount="2" />

They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear &quot;Ethiopian arabica&quot; or &quot;Indonesian robusta&quot; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Roast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: &lt;em&gt;the customer not the espresso must wait&lt;/em&gt;.

Normally, it is ideal to fill up the cezve up to one third to the half of its height before beginning the brewing process. You need the rest of the height during the foaming time. You cannot fill it up to the neck and start brewing. In that case, at the end, when bubbles start to appear, it will spill over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Turkey, cezve is usually sold in sets. You can see a set of old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves in the image below. This set includes 1-cup to 5-cup cezves. However, I don't recommend them as the metal is not thick, so the heat is not homogeneously distributed while brewing. A second disadvantage is, tin plating could be worn away in time and copper oxidizes easily. The green colored copper-oxide is quite poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A modern stainless steel cezve set is also shown below.

Let's talk about the shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be practical, see inside. Check the spoon for stirring in the second image. You can see its length is ideal for stirring without burning your hand. Your hand will be over the vaporizing coffee most of the time. Find your ideal spoon, together with your cezve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it can clearly be seen, the shape is more or less the same. Wider bottom is mostly a result of finding proper balance on top of the stoves for small sized ones. You can see it when you look at them in the sets next to each other. If the bottom is wider, the neck seems narrower. When you have heavier stainless steel cezves, balance is already there, so the bottom is not that wider, thus the neck is not that narrower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I must admit that, a narrow neck is also related with the foam. The foam is formed by carbon dioxide packed in coffee lipids. When you heat the coffee, the carbon dioxide is extracted together with lipids and cannot be solved after some threshold in water. Those carbon dioxide changes its phase to gas form such as any effervescent, forming bubbles. This is the foam of Turkish coffee. If you try to brew Turkish coffee in a pan, the bubbles will be too far away and cannot survive in the surface of the coffee. They will soon pop and fade away. If they are close together, some irregularities of coffee (such as small particles in the coffee powder) stick on the surface of the bubbles and keep them together. Then, the bubbles form the foam. That's the reason a narrow neck helps to keep the foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastActivityDate="2016-03-27T18:54:10.010" CommentCount="1" />

The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant.

As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis.

Caffeine alone is very effective at perking a person up but if paired with sugar this can have a double &quot;energy effect since the sugar will also increase energy levels...but sugar will also cause a &quot;sugar crash&quot; (that is another topic, regarding insulin/glucose levels in the blood.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So lets say you don't drink large doses of caffeine on a regular basis and you want to try and drink this famous &quot;cup of Joe&quot; from Starbucks, what could go wrong? well it all depends on your caffeine tolerance. Just like a habitual user of nicotine or other stimulating drugs will be affected differently, a caffein user will tolerate different levels of a cup of joe depending on their weight, liver function to metabolize the caffeine and how much water you drink + kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a drug:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is no more different than nicotine or cocaine, Why? because caffeine is considered a stimulant very much like nicotine and cocaine, it produces very similar effects thus some of the side effects may be similar as well. Also, caffeine is habit forming and a person can become dependent or addicted to it, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when coming off it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.[10] It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but — unlike many other psychoactive substances — it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative. Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a &quot;kick&quot; caused in part by the drug's stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body, causing a sudden release of glucose as well as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, causing smokers to be slightly hyperglycemic. In addition, nicotine indirectly causes a release of dopamine in the brain regions that control pleasure and motivation. This reaction is similar to that seen with other abused drugs—such as cocaine and heroin—and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations many smokers experience. In contrast, nicotine can also exert a sedative effect, depending on the level of the smoker's nervous system arousal and the dose of nicotine taken.&lt;/em&gt; &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nicotine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nicotine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2396" LastEditorUserId="2396" LastEditDate="2016-04-05T17:21:15.963" LastActivityDate="2016-04-05T17:21:15.963" CommentCount="2" />

This is inline with &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2570/how-best-to-reduce-tannins-in-black-coffee/2571#2571&quot;&gt;MT San's comment and related answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Later...&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to &quot;drip-brew&quot;, so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew emphasizes &quot;green&quot; or &quot;herbal&quot; notes, though.

If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents &lt;strong&gt;channelling&lt;/strong&gt;, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change your beans.

French press is one of the most popular brewing methods in the world, and rightly so: it's dead easy to operate and produces a great cup of coffee.

Control over the brew is probably the most important, and with French press is there really anything you could add?

Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype (&quot;elephant bean&quot;) is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another famous varietal is the &quot;Gesha&quot; (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called &quot;Geisha&quot;). This came to light when an estate in Pananma &quot;La Esmarelda&quot; noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee.

You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;At least two burr grinders with dose control&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Refrigeration&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Misc Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be blending stuff, get a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ticket Handling System&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water.

Got a place that delivers it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad.

There will be other minor techniques, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these techniques are in essence used to protect the bean from bacteria, mold and fungi right after the harvest. The coffee fruit is full of sugar and fermentation starts rapidly after the fruit leaves the tree. Thus, peeling of the fruit from the bean rapidly may help to get rid of the mold risk. If you choose to get the fruity tastes affect your bean and leave the fruit around your bean, then you should take proper care about mold and fungi. This may be especially difficult in big plantations as you need around 20 days and huge flat areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet process&lt;/strong&gt; can be said the industry standard. The fruit is &lt;em&gt;totally peeled off to the bean&lt;/em&gt;, then the beans are dried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.a. &lt;strong&gt;Double-washed process&lt;/strong&gt; is a process that the fruits are first washed to the bean. After the fermentation starts, it is washed for a second (or several) times. This technique is also known as &lt;em&gt;Kenyan process&lt;/em&gt;. The result is a very clean flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;dry process&lt;/strong&gt;, the fruits are left intact to dry themselves. During this process, they should be moved regularly to protect them from mold and fungus. When the humidity is around 13%, they are peeled of, washed and dried for the second round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Semi-dry/semi-washed/pulped-natural/honey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;just the skin of the fruit&lt;/em&gt; is peeled of, but the meaty part is left on the bean. Then, the fruit is dried, peeled of to the bean, washed and dried for the second round.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.a. In &lt;strong&gt;50% washed&lt;/strong&gt; processing method is the method where the processing is akin to honey method, but the meaty part of the fruit is peeled of halfway to the bean. This peeling of may be done in the beginning or sometime during the fermentation. As mentioned, the aim is balancing the sugar level and protecting the beans from mold, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that &lt;strong&gt;pulp-natural&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;dry&lt;/strong&gt; processing are costlier than &lt;strong&gt;wet&lt;/strong&gt; processing -whatever the metric is; monetary, labor or time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is flavor. &lt;strong&gt;Dry&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;pulp-natural&lt;/strong&gt; processed beans include more fruity notes as the fruit fermented together with the bean during the first drying phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It is said that pulp-natural beans are less acidic than dry beans, but I have not experience that myself.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that, dry or pulp-natural processing is not available everywhere. E.g. if you see a bag of Guatemala dry processed beans*, just run away. As Guatemalan weather is so humid, you can hardly dry process the fruit without mold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(*) Probably, it doesn't even exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/coffee-processing-differences-ethiopia-what-is-dry-vs-washed-coffees-ethiopia-kenya-costa-rica-brazil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Further reading&lt;/a&gt; that matches origins and processing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-06-20T12:46:26.303" LastActivityDate="2016-06-20T12:46:26.303" CommentCount="4" />

It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="76" LastEditDate="2016-04-27T19:00:10.940" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T19:00:10.940" CommentCount="0" />

From what I could gather, there are two points here, one theoretical and one empiric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, caffeine is one of the fastest-extracting compounds in coffee, such that it is extracted almost immediately, so, logically, the amount of caffeine in a brew would only be determined by the amount of beans that go into it and not the brewing method. Which means that whatever comes out of the AeroPress could not possibly have that much more caffeine than other methods. Particularly, not significantly more than an espresso shot, since the amounts of coffee used are about the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My own experience, however, suggests otherwise.&#xA;When I first got my AeroPress, I (naturally) brewed some coffee with it. Upon drinking just half of the brew, I got a kick stronger than after anything I'd ever consumed before. Several days later I hosted a party where I served AeroPress coffee, and about two thirds of the guests independently noted that the coffee was unusually strong. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solving this contradiction seems pretty hard. Right now I see several (not entirely exclusive) possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;first, that AeroPress brew really does have a significantly higher caffeine content. &#xA;&lt;em&gt;Pretty unlikely, but the possibility is nonzero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;second, that AeroPress brew contains high concentrations of some non-caffeine compounds, which:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;are produced  in significantly lower quantities with other brewing methods, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strongly contribute to the typical effects of consuming lots of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't know how likely this is, since I'm not aware of whether caffeine is the only major contributor to the effects of coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;finally, that it is mainly a placebo-like psychological effect.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Also unlikely, since the guests at the party probably did not have any prior preconceptions about AeroPress coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line: coffee from the AeroPress does tend to be perceived as stronger than average by a variety of people (including stronger after-coffee effects), but caffeine might not be the reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1922" LastEditorUserId="1922" LastEditDate="2017-01-10T07:58:01.523" LastActivityDate="2017-01-10T07:58:01.523" CommentCount="3" />

First off, I've tasted coffees made with both Lavazza Quality Oro and BonCafe beans. Both are rubbish. Honestly. Try some freshly roasted coffee and you'll know the difference. Having said that, let's move on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you've described in the question is talking mainly about extraction.&#xA;Coffee gets extracted as below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sour &gt; Flavour &gt; Bitter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's sour, it's underextracted. If it's bitter, it's over extracted. Now this does not mean there will not be any sour or bitter notes in the coffee. There will be but it needs to be balanced.&#xA;The roasting of the coffee plays an important role too. Some coffees are roasted for far too long and they come out tasting bitter. This is usually the case when the roaster is either inexperienced or is trying to cover up poor quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To adjust extraction, you can adjust temperature, grind size and brewing method. Some like drip causes the water to flow over the the grounds at rate that's proportional to the flow of water into the drip brewer (like Hario V60) and the size of grinds. Some others, like Aeropress, lets the grinds steep in the water with a little bit of agitation. You need to pick one method that you're comfortable with, then adjust the parameters for that brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try increasing and reducing water temperature too.&#xA;So how will you know you got a good cup? Taste it. When you start to taste flavours that you've never encountered with that coffee before, you know you're heading in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.

During this time, some carbon dioxide is emitted as a result of this process and jailed within the cell structure. During this reaction, many organic molecules within the bean are pyrolysed (chemically separated by fire). Probably at that phase, many aromatic lipids emerge that we are actually tasting and trying to extract during brewing. Note that, more fruity aromas were already in the bean before pyrolysis (or caramelization, Maillard reaction, roasting... You may use interchangeably).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's reason about under- and over- roasted beans:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;under-roasted beans&lt;/strong&gt;, you have less carbon dioxide. So you have less foam. You have less aromatic lipids, so you have less aroma.

I'm a barista and head of customer education at Handground. We are working on a French Press brew guide right now but since it's not done, I'll share a quick tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal with brewing coffee on any device is to maximize the extraction of good-tasting flavors and minimize the bitter ones. I suggest starting with the following recipe and then adjusting it to find the right balance of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat water to 205F&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your kettle, this might mean taking your water off the heat for about one minute after boil. Use a thermometer if possible!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weigh out coffee to 57g&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's an easy ratio to follow when deciding how much coffee to use. It's called the water-to-coffee ratio, and it will help you methodically experiment with different brew recipes. To find the water-to-coffee ratio, take the total mL of water (around 800-850mL for a normal-sized French Press) and then divide by the number of grams of coffee (mL and grams are conveniently equal in weight). In this case, 800/57 is about 14. That means our ratio is 14:1. From now on you can use the inverse of this ratio to adjust your recipe. For example, if you want to try a 15:1 ratio (a weaker coffee), take 800ml and divide by 15 to find the amount of coffee to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a scale, 57g is roughly a half cup of coffee, but remember that lighter roasts are more dense than dark roasts, so it will require less volume of coffee to reach your desired weight. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee course&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what your grind should look like: &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Handground french press grind&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's really important to have a consistent grind. If you don't the different-sized grounds will extract at different rates, meaning some of them will turn bitter and others will stay weak. This is a bad mix of flavors. For the most consistent grind, use a burr &lt;a href=&quot;http://handground.com/handground&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;coffee grinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pour water over coffee and let bloom&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dump the grounds into the French Press and then pour just enough water over the grounds so they are all saturated. If you have a scale, shoot for about as much water as you have grounds, so 57mL. The coffee will begin to bubble up and &quot;bloom&quot; if it is fresh. Let this happen for about 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pour 800mL water total, set for 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour 800mL of hot water into the French Press to achieve our desired water-to-coffee ratio. For most a normal 32-ounce French Press, this is about an 1 1/2 inches from the top. Start timer for 4 minutes and let the coffee steep. Place the lid on top of the grounds to capture the heat but DO NOT PLUNGE YET!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plunge after 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Press the plunger down through the coffee. This action will tell you something important about your coffee. If pressing the plunger is really difficult, the grind might have been too fine. There should be slight resistance but nothing that makes you struggle. This is one indication that you might need to adjust the grind, but tasting the coffee will be the ultimate test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove all coffee from French Press&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the coffee (the drink, not the grounds) in the French Press will allow for the coffee to continue extracting, turning it bitter. If you don't drink it all at once, remove it and place in a thermos or carafe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjusting your brew recipe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This recipe is just a starting point. Now you should adjust your recipe to improve the coffee. The best cups of coffee have extracted all the sweet, desirable flavors from the cup and none of the bitter, negative flavors. Naturally then, the best cup of coffee sits right at the tipping point of sweet and bitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should adjust your recipe by changing just one thing at a time. Here's a simple formula to follow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assess your latest cup of coffee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was your coffee strong and sweet? Weak and bitter? Somewhere in the middle? Understanding this will be the starting point for adjusting your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for coffee strength&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You adjust the strength of your coffee by changing the amount of coffee you use. We can use the water-to-coffee ratio that we talked about to do this. If your coffee is weak, or watery and tea-like, use a lower water-to-coffee ratio like 13:1 or 12:1. If your coffee is overwhelmingly strong, raise the ratio to 15:1 or 16:1. Divide the amount of water used (800ml) by desired ratio number (14, 15, 16, etc.) to find the number of grams of coffee to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew another batch of coffee with the adjusted water-to-coffee ratio and repeat until you're happy with the strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for sweetness/extraction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength and extraction are not the same thing. Strength is the amount of coffee dissolved in the coffee solution while extraction is the percentage of ground coffee that was dissolved. Extraction controls how sweet or bitter a coffee is, but not its strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your coffee is bitter, you should reduce the extraction rate. You can do this in two ways: Make the grind more course or shorten the brew time. Both will allow for less extraction, meaning less negative flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your coffee is sweet, I suggest finding its peak sweetness before being satisfied. Increase the extraction rate by using a finer grind or extending the brew time. Do this until you brew a batch of coffee that comes out bitter, and then dial your extraction rate back to the last degree where it was sweet. This is as delicious as you will be able to brew your coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize what I just wrote, here are a few key things to remember about brewing with the French Press and dialing in the optimal recipe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistent grind is key&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is weak, increase the strength by adding more coffee. If it is too strong, use less coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is still sweet and not bitter, increase the extraction by using a finer grind or longer brew time. Do this until you find the tipping point between bitter and sweet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your coffee is bitter, dial back the extraction. Again, try to find the tipping point. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the different variables that change your coffee will become second nature the more you do it. Start sharpening your coffee skills by being methodical with the way you experiment. Adjust only one variable at a time so you can see a clear cause and effect. Most importantly, don't let the pursuit of the perfect cup spoil the fun. Any cup of coffee is better than no cup at all, so enjoy the journey. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1786" LastActivityDate="2016-05-14T20:05:29.820" CommentCount="0" />

This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely.

The special rubber stoppers have a one-way valve in them which allows air to be removed and held under a partial vacuum.  The advantage of this method is two fold.  First, the container is as full of beans as I can get it which minimizes the space available for air (oxygen is the bad guy).  After pumping out the air with the little hand pump, it creates a partial vacuum which extracts additional oxygen from the bottle but also promotes the accelerated off-gassing of carbon dioxide.  I know the beans are emitting CO2 because for the first day or two I can continue to pump out gas from the bottle.  After that, the bottle holds a vacuum indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've stored freshly roasted beans like this for at least a couple of weeks with no noticeable loss of flavor.  After I open the bottle and begin to use the beans, I can re-seal it; although the more space there is in the bottle, the more oxygen will remain in the bottle even after I pump it out.  After using a couple of days worth, I more often transfer it to a zip lock baggie that I can roll up and extract air from.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer storage than a couple of weeks I can't comment on because I don't roast coffee that far in advance.

Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the &quot;ideal&quot; extraction time)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="96" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-07-21T20:19:47.533" LastActivityDate="2016-11-01T14:12:32.027" Title="What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?"

A finer grind makes a lower packing density.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Weigh the ground coffee and compare that to the weight of ground coffee that you used to use so the density variation between beans won't be a factor.

For almost all varietals of beans, my target roast levels end up in the 14:30 to 16:00 minute range for a half pound of green coffee beans.  Recently, however, I have been experimenting with significantly longer roasts (~30% to 50% longer).  I set the machine to max (482F) let it run 12 minutes or so, then crank it down to 425F or so and run to just short of target.  Generally this has been adding 4 to 8 minutes to my roasts times.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obvious disadvantage is the extra time it takes me to be involved with the roast.  The advantage I was going for was that it is much easier to hit a target roast with such a long window at the &quot;end of roast&quot;.  However, I seem to notice another potential advantage.  The coffee seems to taste much better after much shorter rest times.  With my old shorter method coffees came into their peak seemingly around 72 to 96 hours later.  With this new method, the coffee seems to be hitting that same stride at 24 or 48 hours.

In this case of leaving a batch of coffee with a batch of water (assume pure water for simplicity), materials (different components) will diffuse out of the coffee driven by concentration differences for each materials in water and in the ground coffee. There is a constant exchange of these materials going from the ground coffee into water and going from what has gone into water back to the ground coffee. Each material has its own diffusion rate and solubility in water for a given temperature. Eventually, there will be an equilibrium. Thus, assuming no chemical reaction takes place for now, no matter how long you leave that brew, temperature alone will dictate how much of each material in the coffee stays in the water and how much stays in the ground coffee. Without facts, qualitatively, I imagine an overnight brew in the fridge will give you more than enough time to reach that equilibrium and brewing it for another day or two will not change anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, many organic components will hydrolyse to some degree when exposed to water especially when there is a pH shift. I do not know enough to speculate on which component in the coffee will face what kind of hydrolysis at what temperature, but generally the hydrolysis reaction rate increases with temperature. I am speculating that undesirable flavours are about both products of hydrolysis and increased solubility of &quot;bad&quot; components. There is also the likelihood of other reactions at higher temperatures say between acids and lipids or proteins and sugars or perhaps the breakdown of polysaccharides into shorter sugars and oxidation of sugars to acids and so on. These are much more likely to produce flavours than denaturing of proteins which I think (not certain) tends to have little to no impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to systematically visualise this, I think one would go through a matrix of temperature, time and grind size and put the &quot;extract&quot; through an HPLC to quantify the concentration of each component. Ultimately, a sensitive nose/tongue is the real test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from this, I always feel that the drip method has to be the least desirable as you are constantly putting pure water to leach out materials from the coffee, always encouraging more materials to come out leaving no room for &quot;bad&quot; stuff to be left behind. If you taste the drip as the brewing progresses, you can definitely tell that about half way through, the coffee actually tastes foul and it gets worse. This is a leaching process designed to maximise extraction. This is exactly what happens at the fresh solvent end of an industrial counter-current extraction process to maximise concentration gradient and diffusion rate - not what you want for just taking the desirable bits out of coffee. It would be preferable to recirculate the brew through the grounds so that &quot;strength&quot; builds up to an equilibrium and by adjusting the temperature, you can control that equilibrium to achieve &quot;optimal&quot; taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with cold brew and find that the brew tends to lack aroma while hot brew tends to have both a harsher taste and distorted aroma. Ideally, if there is a way to preserve the aroma of freshly roasted beans, that would be best. So far, I favour as fine a grind as practical, start with room temperature water, agitate and gradually raise the temperature to above 60C (have not found the preferred temperature yet but I dare not push it over 90C) nearer to the time of drinking. Once filtered, I can heat or chill the coffee as desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Editor's note:&lt;/em&gt; Additionally, an anonymous user suggested the following content...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold/warm brew is much more forgiving, relying on achieving some equilibrium and making grind size and time redundant variables. Hot brew on the other hand for everyday coffee making is mostly about guessing when to stop the leaching process abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fine grind is sometimes falsely blamed for over-extraction bitterness. From my experience, bitterness from fine grind has mostly to do with small coffee solids staying suspended in the coffee. It is very telling if you make coffee using a fine grind (say espresso grind) in a press/cafetier, pour a third into a cup as control, another third through a filter, and double filter the remainder, you will be able to taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3022" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2016-08-22T15:53:03.473" LastActivityDate="2016-08-22T15:53:03.473" CommentCount="0" />

The coffee is then dehydrated into a powder.

However, keeping on topic, there is a lot of personal preference involved when it comes to coffee, and it could be that the taste isn't triggering that wake up moment for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @Ecnerwal mentioned, there are &quot;standards&quot; regarding temperature which may or may not suit your tastes. Like @Ecnerwal, my approach to brewing coffee is to listen to the sound of the kettle. Sometimes I miss the cues and the kettle boils, in which case I add some cold water to the grounds before the boiled water. I find that, most of the time, I prefer coffee brewed at a much lower temperature than the &quot;standard&quot; as it has a deeper, heavier flavour, but go too low and it tastes flat to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is brewing time. My basic approach used to be to grind 3 tablespoons of beans, add the water, wait ~1m40, one big stir quickly near the surface, wait ~1m40 and then press and drink. At some point I realised that the stir could be left out if I left the coffee to stand for longer (which makes sense based on how caffeine extraction works). The taste was equally satisfying, but 4 minutes without stirring just wouldn't do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is the coffee itself. Whenever I get a new batch of coffee there is a degree of trial and error regarding time, quantity, temperature for me to get it right. Less so if I buy a blend, more so  single origin. Different coffee has slightly different needs. Then there is the whole Arabica/Robusta/Other debate. Robusta seems to have a bad name, but you might actually prefer the taste and it generally has more caffeine content. One of the best coffees I have ever had was 100% robusta from a local roasters, and it certainly packed a caffeine punch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the problem might not be a matter of coffee but a matter of ritual. That big sense of relief for me comes with the first sip of coffee, before it can possibly have had any physical effect. The very idea of having coffee does the trick.

Recently I found information from a few sources that when combined have resulted in some really nice roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first piece of information I found was the temperatures for the heat settings of the FreshRoast SR 500:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  Setting  |  Temp  |&#xA;| :-------- | :----- |&#xA;|  High     |  490   |&#xA;|  Medium   |  455   |&#xA;|  Low      |  390   |  &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second piece of information I found was the temperature at which coffee beans begin a process called pyrolysis.  At about 400 degrees Fahrenheit pyrolysis begins in coffee beans.  Pyrolysis is the process of chemical change within the bean that generates heat.  When this process happens in coffee we hear it as a popping sound known as first crack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the SR 500 a temperature setting of Medium is high enough to raise coffee beans to this temperature.  I had been using a high heat setting to roast coffee, and the resulting beans had a very smoky flavor, which was not very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional research yielded some additional wisdom that I find sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Apply adequate energy at the beginning of a roast&#xA;2. Make sure that the bean temperature progression always decelerates&#xA;3. Make sure that first crack begins at 75% to 80% of total roast time&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This information is sound when trying to roast to a City or City+ level, which is fortunate for me as I am aiming for a nice medium roast for pour over coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to an information card I received from Sweet Maria's with my first order of coffee from them, city/city+ is achieved at the tail end of first crack at a temperature range of 415 to 435 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applying adequate energy at the beginning of a roast is not the problem with the FreshRoast SR 500.  I find that the roaster applies too much energy and roasts much too fast.  If anything, I needed to find a way to slow down the drying phase, as the beginning of the roast is often called, and developed a procedure for stretching that out with this roaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I start by using an interval timer app on my tablet designed for use with interval training exercise to precisely time the steps in my process.  To slow down the initial drying process I alternate heating for twelve seconds and cooling for six seconds and repeat this cycle for twenty-four intervals.  The interval timer helps me remember what step I'm on and prompts me to switch the roaster from heating to cooling and back precisely.  During this phase I apply only low heat with the fan speed on high.  I also physically lift the roaster base and tilt the roaster several degrees away from vertical and rotate the roaster around its vertical axis.  This agitates the green beans in the chamber and helps prevent scorching.  I roast batches of 90 grams and find that this batch size also prevents scorched beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A decelerating temperature progression means that the rate of temperature rise should slow down during the roast.  It doesn't mean that the temperature should lower but that the rate of temperature increase should be faster earlier in the roast and slower later in the roast.  When the beans reach first crack there is a spike in bean temperature from the heat being generated internally by pyrolysis.  In anticipation of first crack and knowing that the roaster will not respond instantly to changes in heat settings, I lower the heat just prior to first crack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advice to make sure that first crack begins between 75% and 80% of total roast time is only a guideline, but I find that adhering to it gives me very nice coffee.  So with all of this information up front, here is how I apply it with the FreshRoast SR 500.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I begin by preheating the roaster using high heat and the fan control at the 3 O'clock position.  This allows all of the roaster parts to absorb as much heat as they can and prevents the roaster from sucking heat away from the beans.  I follow a set rhythm while roasting one 90-gram batch at a time.  While the beans are being cooled by the roaster after completing the roasting cycle I weigh out the next 90-gram batch.  When the roaster stops I immediately pour out the beans into a tray, turn the roaster back on using low heat and low fan speed, clean out the chaff collector, and load the next batch of beans into the roast chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preheat the roaster for 2 full cycles at a fan speed of 3 O'clock and using high heat.  Run the roaster on low heat and low fan speed between batches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start with a roast time of 2.8 minutes.

A lot has to do with the variety of beans being roasted and your heat application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I think happened to you was that you lost control of your heat. At first crack your beans become exothermic (give off heat) and you didn't reduce your heat. What happened then is that you had too much heat at raced through the &quot;development&quot; time in your roast profile. &#xA;To correct this you should reduce your heat at the start of first crack and develop the flavor by how much/long  you let the beans go for before taking them off the heat.&#xA;This is a critical time for your roast because your are developing the flavor in your roast by time and roast level.

After years of using basic automatic drip coffee makers this was an adjustment. I still haven't perfected the art of the cup using the Bonavita. The problem is that the Bonavita brews at the correct temperature, so I think you really need to be a little more precise when brewing (at least that's what I discovered).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the Bonavita brews only 8 cups--and each cup is only 5 oz. I use a scale to get as close as I can to the correct water-coffee ratio. I no longer use a scoop: a scale is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found that with the Bonavita a medium course grind is best. I also found that lighter roasts are less likely to produce the bitter flavor you are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually brew at a water ratio of 1:14. So that means that I use about 84 grams of coffee for a full pot. I know, seems like a lot of coffee. i never used that much with my Mr. Coffee.  But, once you figure out the correct grind and amount, the Bonavita produces a great cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/&lt;/a&gt; and read the article. The &quot;Coffee Compass&quot; really helped me out in trying to get that great cup. Just the other day, I ground up some coffee at a slightly higher setting and the coffee was weak. So now, using that setting, I had to up the amount of coffee by a couple of grams and it was perfect. And that was thanks to the Coffee Compass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is so trial and error, I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the basic ratios to use with the Bonavita. I have found that the 1:14 produces the better cup in my opinion. Also, lighter roasts tend to not be as bitter as the darker roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bonavita cup = 5 oz.

Luckily, the big roasters have nice roasters for big batches. However, if you are visiting a small local coffee shop, it is possible that they have still using a pan to roast and burning the flat side of the bean and cannot roast the curvy side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below, you can see a photo from one of the most popular shopping malls of Istanbul. You can clearly see the uneven roast. I don't even discuss the storage conditions here! The damp, the light, the air...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTw7t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTw7t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the roast degree... Normally, cinnamon to city roast is the advised degree for proper Turkish coffee. However, bulk producers mostly goes beyond first crack, even to the second crack to hide the &lt;em&gt;moldy&lt;/em&gt; flavors. The result is more like Vietnamese style; very dark roasted charcoal flavors. This is not what it used to be. However, the packaged roasted and ground Turkish coffee is mostly that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the question remains, what makes it special? How do you feel a mouthful when you taste it at the headquarters and cannot reproduce it at home?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is, &lt;strong&gt;freshness&lt;/strong&gt;. That's what you feel, in my opinion. Most bulk roasters do not even care about degassing as they are selling anyway. (This may affect the taste, I assume. They start grinding right after roasting to get rid of stock expenses.) They sell to the tourists or to the ignorant Turkish population. Still, at the end, when you visit their headquarters, you smell a very fragrant coffee flavor. This adds to the aroma you taste. (You know, they say onion and apple taste the same when you don't smell them.) Then, you drink a very fresh cup of coffee. This is very probably nice as it is just roasted, even if the beans were bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you buy a bag of very fine grounded over-roasted bad coffee. The bag itself does not have a one-way-valve or it is not filled with inert gases or it is not vacuum packed. Thus, it goes stale very rapidly. Note that, fine grounded coffee goes stale more quickly. Even during your trip to your home. So maybe you have one or two days to finish the bag, if not a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; There is nothing special about Turkish coffee. It goes stale stale just so quickly as it is grounded so fine.

I use a hot air roaster, the Fresh Roast SR500 and I've done many hours of internet research to try and get a basic understanding of home roasting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first basic principle of roasting is that you want the temperature of the beans to be constantly rising.  If the beans ever cool during the roast cycle, you've most likely ruined them.  It doesn't sound like this is a problem for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second basic principle is that the heat should rise at a rate no faster than the full mass of the beans can absorb.  This means that the temperature needs to rise evenly in the whole bean, not just the outer part.  If the temperature rises too fast, the outer bean will begin to burn while the inner bean hasn't yet fully dried, so the whole batch is again ruined.  This sounds like what is happening to your roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commercial roasters and home roasters using drum roasters are able to roast large batches but at a slower rate than my hot air roaster.  This will give a particular flavor profile to a bean that my roaster won't be able to duplicate, primarily because my hot air roaster simply roasts too fast.  Nevertheless, I've been able to get very good results with my roaster by learning how to slow it down as much as necessary while still keeping the temperature rising throughout the roast cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've read in more than one place on roasting forums that first crack (FC) should occur somewhere around 75-80% of the way through the entire roast cycle and should last for as short a time as possible, generally less than 2-3 minutes.  My own current roast profile has FC starting around the 6 minute mark and I'm starting my cooling cycle at around 7:40 shortly after FC ends.  Not exactly the 75-80% time frame, but those folks are generally using drum roasters in the 15-20 minute range for a complete cycle.  They also recommend a roast time no shorter than 10 minutes, but again, that is for a drum roaster.  My coffee tastes fantastic with my current profile.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get your bean temperatures to rise at a reasonable rate, there is a definite pause between first and second crack, and there is a distinct difference in the sounds of FC vs SC.  Since you are using a popcorn popper on a stove burner, I wouldn't be able to give you any better guidance than this, but your 1 cup of beans is relatively small, so I don't think these times are unreasonable.  I'm generally roasting 100 grams of raw beans per charge.  Your one cup sounds like it's probably I bit more than 100 grams.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would advise you to go online, search &quot;home coffee roasting forums&quot; and start reading.  I would also strongly advise you to start logging each and every batch you do as to times, weight of beans, heat levels, the outside temperature, smells you detect, what color your socks are, etc.  Just joking about the socks, of course, but the idea is that you'll begin to see some definite trends and you'll be able to home in on the right method for your setup much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, definitely slow things down and aim for ending FC around 7:30 or later if possible.  End of FC generally equates to a medium roast level, although you'll find lots more information about that online as well.  Even with the benefit of the internet and lots of information on the forums, it still took me awhile to get my own setup to produce the results I was looking for so be patient.

Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math is Not Hard:&lt;/strong&gt; If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation (&quot;null hypothesis&quot;) for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were &lt;em&gt;small enough&lt;/em&gt; of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for &quot;statistical significance&quot; is ≤ 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x ≥ K of N correct choices} is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=1 - BINOMDIST(K - 1, N, 1/3, TRUE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so if that value is ≤ 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2908" LastEditorUserId="2908" LastEditDate="2016-12-26T21:36:44.183" LastActivityDate="2016-12-26T21:36:44.183" CommentCount="0" />

Secondly as an enthusiastic coffee drinker and also as someone working with coffee, I find the amount of bad coffee around just astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flavor of the coffee you have in your cup is determined by a wide range of variables, beginning with the species of coffee (arabica vs. robusta), the origin of the bean, the processing after harvest, the roast and finally everything that has to do with the preparation of your cup o' Jo like the grind and extraction time. Bitterness in coffee has two main reasons and is in fact not a desired yet very common flavor. The first reason is due to the roasting process where the chemical compounds in the coffee are broken down and can create a bitter and unpleasant taste. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you'll find some chemical background info on bitterness in coffee. This is typical for very dark over-roasted coffee. Dark roasts tend to lose some of the flavor that is typical to the bean you are using and instead introduces exogenous flavors through the process of roasting itself (through Maillard reactions). Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaladicoffee.com/about-our-coffee/bitterness-and-acidity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt; for some info and nice illustration of the relationship between roasting and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However the arguably more important factor, assuming you are using a light to medium roast which is typical for most speciality coffee is the time of extraction. With extraction I mean roughly the duration in which the water is in contact with your coffee grounds (in reality it is more complex). Depending on the type of preparation this may take between 20-30s for espresso shots, up to several minutes for pour-overs (2-3min for Hario V60, around 4min for Chemed) and even many hours for a cold brewed coffee. If the contact time between water and grounds is too long you will over extract your coffee which results in the bitterness you didn't like. On the other side, underextraction results in sourness. A well extracted coffee should be sweet, fruity, have some acidity and very little bitterness. Most of the coffee you get in coffee shops is over-extracted in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it may be that the bitterness you are describing is in fact just due to a bad coffee you had. I suggest you try some good coffee and you might just like it. Or maybe you won't which is also fine. Most people I know who drink coffee do it for the caffein and the kick they get out of it in the morning (I'd rather have some green or black tea if that's the only purpose). I personally drink coffee because I love the great variety and complexity of flavors. A well sourced and well prepared cup of coffee can be something really beautiful to use your words. It starts with the farmers though who spend a lot of effort in cultivating the best possible cherries, or with the roasters who only use the best grade beans and it ends with the barista who knows what's behind the coffee they prepare and how best to do so. I can not stand the very dark, over extracted coffee that you seem to describe. It is bitter, ashy, hollow and it actually just baffles me that people still drink it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastActivityDate="2016-10-20T14:01:38.587" CommentCount="0" />

Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered.

Grinding is a crucial, yet overlooked component of the brewing process. It’s not as simple as just grinding the beans in any old coffee grinder. An even grind is the perfect grind. If you don’t have a good grinder, you won’t extract enough flavor out of the beans. Blade grinders can’t provide an even grind so when hot water for brewing passes over the ground, it’s passing over an uneven surface area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We recommend that if you decide to grind beans yourself, get a burr or mill grinder. These types of grinders grind the coffee in an even consistency. Uniform consistency is essential when it comes to extracting the most flavor out of your coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to purchasing our beans, it doesn’t really matter whether you buy them whole or ground.

Ground coffee is &quot;fresh&quot; for several hours (you will also find varying data|opinions on this, but it's generally much shorter). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind size (combined with immersion) time has a direct and noticeable impact on the final cup product.  Finer grinds (and longer immersion times) produce a different flavor profile than coarser grind and short immersion times.  Then there are cross over examples like espresso which gets a unique profile by using a fine grind and short extraction time (perhaps the shortest).  There are several questions on the site relating to how grind size, immersion time and temperature affect flavor profile.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2016-10-21T16:34:21.457" CommentCount="0" />

If someone complains in the same bakery about coffee that is too strong they probably mean that it is too bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a coffee professional is talking about coffee strength however, they are most likely referring to the total amount of dissolved solids (or TDS) which is measured with a refractometer. An espresso ranges somewhere in between 7% and 15% while a filter coffee is somewhere around 1,5%. That means an espresso is 93%-85% water and a filter 98,5%. The rest is what has been extracted from the coffee. Keep in mind that this is not to be confused with extraction. Higher extraction (bitter coffee) doesn't make a strong, but actually a &quot;weak&quot; coffee. Because you are running more water through the coffee the TDS will start to decrease at the point where the next ml of water is extracting less of the solids than the ml before. That means that in terms of flavor &quot;strong&quot; means often the opposite of what people would actually associate with a strong coffee. Holding the dosage constant, a strong espresso (too little water, thus something like a ristretto) would taste kind of sour, salty and unbalanced. A weak espresso (too much water) would taste bitter.&#xA;The point is, strength refers at first not to flavor but to the TDS which is determined by your coffee preparation and not by the roasting. The same coffee roasted darker is not stronger, it just received more heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, your package of coffee probably refers with it's &quot;three out of five strength&quot; to the roast grade (probably a medium to dark roast) which is just misleading marketing in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some additional reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/analyzing-espresso-recipes-strength/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Analyzing espresso recipe strength&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/espresso-recipes-understanding-yield/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Espresso Recipes: Understanding Yield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-11-09T13:21:50.193" LastActivityDate="2016-11-09T13:21:50.193" CommentCount="0" />

I suggest you experiment with the recipe a few times before you sell it to get the kind of cold brew you want and to get to know the coffee you are selling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like very strong cold brew, so my recipe would be 1:4 or 1:5 coffee to water (and I think this is roughly what Toddy suggests as well). Let it steep for about 6 to 12 hours, again depending on your taste. This gives you a concentrate that you can either dilute with water or I personally just pour a shot of it over a lot of ice and drink it like that. It gives a very sweet, full bodied cold brew. Most of the cold brew sold is way too diluted for my taste, I prefer the sirupy concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However you may not like it that way, so you could dilute the brew or experiment with the recipe. If the flavor is too intense try 1:6, then 1:8 and so on. I'd not go any lower than 1:10, although many people do. In the end it's a matter of taste and in your case how you want to sell it (diluted, on ice, in bottles etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also cold brew lasts a good week (arguably even 2 weeks) if you keep it refrigerated, so you can make several batches in advance with a toddy.

Generally speaking what you should aim for is a espresso that is full bodied, sweet, fruity with crisp acidity, a syrupy mouth feel and an amazing aftertaste that stays with you long after you finished the cup. What you don't want to get are any sour (underextraction), bitter (overextraction), ashy flavors and a hollow aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get to that sweet spot different ways, using the single shot or double shot portafilter. There are some general guidelines though that you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally using a double shot porta filter delivers better results. You are more flexibel in adjusting the grind size for example. In basically all specialty coffee shops, double shot baskets are used for making espressos. Surely this has to do with efficiency as well, since you can make 2 shots at the same time. I would suggest you try to find the sweet spot with your combination number 4 (or number 1 if you really don't want any more than a single espresso).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to consider is your recipe. Using a double shot basket what you should aim for is a dose:yield ratio of around 1:2. That means if you start with 20g of coffee (in the double basket), aim for a 40ml yield (for a double espresso). A very common recipe would be to start with an 18g dose and aim for a 36g yield. That would be a double shot or two single shots. If you pull shorter you will get a ristretto (short espresso) and if you push through more water, it would be a lungo. The yield is not fixed, you may adjust it depending on the coffee and taste. It is just a basis for dialing in properly, a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you decided on a recipe you should lock in the dose. Changing the dose, changes everything else, so you want to keep it as consistent as possible. However the grams are not fixed and will change all the time. If you change the coffee type/brand/origin/roast etc. you will have to adjust again. Even variables such as temperature, humidity and how much coffee is in the basket above the grind chamber will influence your grinders behavior and therefore the dose. The only definitive remedy is weighing out every single dose and shot (for home use at least whenever you use new coffee to find a setup that delivers consistently good results with this brand or type, albeit it will not consistently be optimal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the dose and recipe fixed you want to get an extraction time of somewhere between 20 and 30 seconds. Adjust the grind size (keep in mind that your dose changes as well, when you adjust the size, since the grinder measures the time of grinding and not the weight of the coffee) so that you reach the desired extraction time with the given recipe. Don't overdo it though and stay in the espresso grind range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you tamp correctly. Level out the grounds before tamping with slight shaking, hitting the basket on the sides and using your fingers. Try to tamp as straight as possible, the distance between the basket and the edge of the tamper should be equal on all sides. A tilted puck will extract badly. You don't have to tamp terribly hard, just until you don't feel the coffee bed changing any more. Anything more is redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull a shot, taste and reflect if the result is the coffee you want. If it is, good for you, most likely it isn't though and you will have to adjust again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it isn't the coffee you want, try to figure out what's wrong with it. Is it too sour? Probably underextracted. Try to grind slightly finer, so the extraction process takes a few seconds longer to get to the yield you want. Does it taste bitter and hollow? Probably overextraced, in this case do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget everything of the above and follow your taste buds! If one or more of those things doesn't produce taste profiles that you like, just kind of ignore them and try something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a general approach of how to dial in your grinder and produce a nice shot. It is not the only one, it is definitely incomplete and it will not be able to replace experimenting and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also don't bother too much about the pressure at the beginning, try to get consistent results that you like when pulling shots and after a while you will learn and understand your machine better. Also don't forget to flush the group head and portafilter before use, so old coffee oils are removed and you get up to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastActivityDate="2016-11-01T14:12:32.027" CommentCount="0" />

Now lighter roasted coffee will definitely be more acidic so the roast level of the bean can be at play. Not only that, but underextraction can cause high levels of acidity also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only discernible difference I can garner from what you've told me is that in the Aeropress there is a slight form of full immersion brewing.

Then perform Aeropress, French press, pourover, espresso and possibly drip extractions with both beans and note down your gastric reaction to each cup.

However too acidic probably means that your coffee is underextracted. That means the water hasn't had enough time or wasn't hot enough to extract the flavor compounds you want out of the ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few variables that will influence extraction with french press. I already mentioned time and heat. A recipe that I have used with very good results is 6g coffee per 100ml of water, ground to the size of coarse salt with a steep time of 4min. At first you only add a little water (just off the boil), twice to three times the weight of coffee grounds and let sit for 1min. Then give it a stir (there will be grounds on the top forming a crust), add the rest of the water and wait until 4min. Plunge and immediately transfer your coffee to a preheated vessel, either your mugs or a jug. Important here is that you don't let the coffee sit as it will continue to extract and taste bitter after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should give you an even, full bodied extraction. If you feel like it's still too acidic, you could vary the variables involved. If you grind slightly finer the extraction will be higher. Same thing if you increase the brew time a bit. I suggest you just play around and keep in mind that these variables are not independent of each other. Finer grind means faster extraction for example. With a basic understanding of how extraction works you should get the hang of it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the coffee still tastes too acidic although you have tried all suggestions check if the roast is too light, since light roasts tend to have more acidity. Also the origin of your coffee is a factor, african coffees (there are many different regions and processing methods so this is a big generalization) tend to be more acidic, while sumatran coffees are considered the least acidic. Central and South American coffees will often have acidity levels in the middle range.&#xA;It might also be sour because the coffee is stale (around 4 weeks after roasting for whole beans, much much much faster for preground) or it might just be shitty coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a good little intro in the world of extraction (or rather which tastes are associated with different levels of extraction):&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Extraction and How to Taste It&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very nice little graphic with explanations that helps identifying which extraction problem you have and how to solve it:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Coffee Compass.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers and enjoy a nice cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastEditorUserId="2751" LastEditDate="2016-11-05T14:00:27.423" LastActivityDate="2016-11-05T14:00:27.423" CommentCount="0" />

We have a drip stand (Hario or some other fancy wooden thing) as well, but it's just not as good, because the water is dripping on the same spot of coffee grounds constantly. You can mitigate that by placing a round paper filter on the grounds (from Aeropress e.g.), however there will still be some uneven extraction. An alternative is the Filtron system, which is basically the same thing.

Cold brew generally reduces acidity, so it works well with high acidity (african) coffees. Sumatran coffees, which would match your flavor requests, are already very low in acidity so the cold brew method can't really shine here. You can also try natural processed african coffees, they would be more full bodied, chocolaty and with notes of red berries (had an amazing ethiopian natural that tasted incredibly like strawberries). They are not really my thing though, a bit flavor overkill most of the times.&#xA;Central American coffees usually work quite well as well, with a bit more nutty, caramel and chocolaty flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've written something on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3064/what-are-good-methods-to-prepare-and-vend-cold-brew/3185#3185&quot;&gt;in this question&lt;/a&gt; already. In any case I use very high coffee to water ratios and don't dilute the concentrate (just served on a lot if ice).

A lipid/water emulsion forms the outer sphere and some gas is inside this sphere. All these spheres stick to each other with tiny coffee bean fragments invisible to human eye. Let's focus to the gas. The gas is mostly Carbon dioxide that is produced during the Maillard reaction when the coffee beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we know the chemistry behind. There are three (actually four, but water is there all the time) main contents for our recipe to produce crema:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lipids&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coffee bean fragments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Carbon dioxide&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lipids and Carbon dioxide are formed by roasting. Fragments are the very very fine powders emerge as the side product of grinding. Fragments don't leave the ground coffee. Lipids, too. But, Carbon dioxide flies away in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, after roasting the beans, it is better to wait for two to four days (based on many criteria just like bean type, roast level, brewing technique, etc.) for the Carbon dioxide level of the roasted beans to settle. Then, the flavor of those beans will be delicious. After that time, Carbon dioxide fades away and the roasted beans start to stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can reason, if your beans have less Carbon dioxide, your final cup of coffee would have less crema. If you have freshly roasted (e.g. 3-days old) coffee, your final cup of espresso would have a thick foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also known that water pressure affects the crema volume, but should not affect as much as you mentioned here. Even at 7 bars, a decent crema forms according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12452670&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a note, if your machine has difficulties producing enough pressure, more tamping will probably results over-heated water flowing very slowly through the grounds, causing them to burn and all of the lipids to evaporate, could not form the spheres of the crema. As a result, you probably worsen the crema production, coffee odor fills the room but you cannot drink that flavor. Now, all you'll get is boiled coffee juice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of crema is mostly correlated with the freshness of the coffee, not the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-11-19T07:44:26.860" LastActivityDate="2016-11-19T07:44:26.860" CommentCount="3" />

So basically you want to aerate the milk less. Don't overheat the milk or the foam will get stiff, besides you are burning the milk and it will just make your flat white (or any other milk based coffee drink) taste bad and burnt. You can achieve this by just slightly lowering the milk pitcher until you hear the hissing sound. This is when you pull in air into the milk. Don't overdo it, just give it a few hisses and then submerge the nozzle back into the milk so it is rolling and mixing all the foam with the milk to make it silky and smooth. Turn of the steam when it is getting hot, check with the area of your palm underneath the thumb as it is usually more sensitive. If it's getting to hot there, stop the steam. Another sign is the sound of the steaming, when it is getting deeper it's probably done. The surface of the milk should appear smooth and glossy. Too many big bubbles probably means you lowered the pitcher too much and aerated too long. If there's still too much foam or you can see like a kind of solid blob of foam in the middle as you swirl it gently, just pour it out of the pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to pour a nice Flat White with only little foam on top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastActivityDate="2016-11-29T22:16:21.367" CommentCount="0" />

Actually it was first planted as a more resistent variety to leaf rust on one farm in Panama (Esmeralda). They took it from Ethiopia, so it must grow under different conditions (guessing it has to be above 1500m like all Arabica coffees). This actually implies that it might even be less complicated to grow than some other Arabica varieties, leading to the conclusion that it cannot be due to the difficulty of growing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality is definitely very good, since it was winning prices as &quot;the best of Panama&quot; since 2004. It also scores consistently above 90 (exceptional quality) in the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) score. However there are other coffees that score as high or higher and cost only half and less of the price. Thus I'd guess it's mainly a combination of little supply (because for a long time it was only grown on one farm) and telling a nice story about it, that made roasters want it. The taste certainly helps, but can in my opinion not totally explain the price differences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say this holds true in general. Supply and Demand plus marketing your product as something special determines the price. It's a form of market power to differentiate your product from similar products (substitutes), to make it stand out. Just look at Kopi Luwak espresso.

'Dialling in' can mean a multitude of things but in your case it will simply refer to finding the right grind size and/or dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem you seem to have is directly because you are shooting far above and below the the 'right' grind size assuming that you are using the exact same mass of coffee every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find the right grind size, you must have a decent enough grinder that grinds to a uniform level and can be adjusted to a high degree, you should only be adjusting in small amounts. If you do not have a grinder, it will be very hard if not impossible to find a pre-ground bag that works perfectly for you. If you are choking the machine because the particle size is too small, adjust coarser gradually and keep making shots to observe the change in extraction times and flavours. If you are extracting very fast and water is rushing out causing under-extraction, adjust finer. Repeat until you achieve the 'best' flavour you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point, if your coffee still tastes off then your problem may lie in your dosage. You may be using too much or too little coffee causing hindrance to a uniform extraction. Once again, simply adjusting your dosage above and below your current amount in small increments will help you find the spot where the extraction performs the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your coffee still tastes off you may be having temperature stability issues, water quality issues, coffee freshness issues, unstable brew-head pressure issues, poor basket distribution and tamping or any combination of the above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the 'right' grind size for espresso, or any brew method for that matter, is never the same and is dependent on, at the very least, the coffee bean itself which is still a variable even if brewing from the same bag, finding the 'right' grind size is always going to be a chase and 'dialling in' will be an exercise you will almost always have to do if you want the best coffee you can extract from what you have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3255/1702&quot;&gt;MT San's answer&lt;/a&gt; provides a link to a more generic explanation and reference to the different general grind sizes for the different brew methods if you are completely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1702" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2016-12-05T10:34:48.080" CommentCount="2" />

Most people mistakenly think that the key to coffee flavor is grinding your own beans. I am not sure how this thought populated people's heads but many other folks tend to re-enforce this notion, which somehow keeps perpetuating this false notion.  Coffee flavor comes from the oils in the coffee beans, and like all oil, coffee bean oil also goes rancid, and at rate much faster than many people realize. If coffee beans are not stored in a vacuum, air will turn coffee rancid after about five days, and actually you can begin to both taste and smell the difference three days after it is roasted. This is true (Listen up!) whether or not the coffee is ground or not.  Coffee is at it's peak flavor and at its most complex between 18 to 24 hours after it is roasted, and much of the CO2 has been given off. After three days, it starts to flatten out, and at five days, it has lost a good deal of unique flovors.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can do an experiment if you like, by simply smelling the roasted beans after 18 hours, and comparing it to the smell of the beans at five days. Try also scooping up a handful of the same beans and smelling the same newly roasted coffee to the (same variety) of beans that were roasted ten days earlier but stored in the open air.  You will be amazed at how rancid the coffee smells. Unless you have experienced this test with your own nose, it will hard for you to understand why some higher end coffee shops have the ability to brew coffee with intense and complex delicate flavors. There is little mystery here. Your 5-10 day old roast may be freshly ground, but the grounds that result from that effort, are long past their prime. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storing your coffee in the jar in your Fridge or in your freezer won't really preserve your coffee's freshness. You need to keep it in a vacuum (no air please).  You can order a container that comes with a hand pump, and pump out the oxygen.  Simply place he lid on the container, but the rubber stop on (similar to the one used on wine bottles, and using the hand pump, pump out the air.  This will extend the life of your freshly roasted coffee well past the five day maximum, and keep it close to the freshness that it had at day one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, I failed to understand that water temperature was also important. Having the water too hot or not hot enough will spoil your result.  No reason to guess any longer. There are number of pour over kettles that either come with a gauge or can be outfitted with one. I used to boil the water and then estimate how long to wait before pouring. That is not a recipe for success. Buy the bloody gauge! It's important, and that way, you can learn for yourself how temperature affects flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use a quality paper filter if you don't have a gold filter. Note that the gold filter has to fit the shape of the metal or ceramic holder it goes into perfectly. Otherwise the flow rate is most often going to be incorrect. One of the most famous brands of filters no longer makes a gold insert that fits their famous long standing ceramic cone holder. Corporate blunder. Too bad.  You might find one third party. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I can taste the fact that bleached paper has somewhat less of a paper taste, but I do wet the paper before hand pouring hot water through it.  I also do the same if I am using a natural non-bleached paper or bamboo paper. There does seem to be less paper taste if I do. If you want to taste all of the complex additional flavors that come with fresh beans, you might also find that wetting the paper before putting the grounds in, and actually pouring some water through first does help. Why not experiment?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long to let the coffee bloom before slowly pouring the rest your water through the grounds.  Why not experiment with each variety of bean. The fineness of the grind is a factor to how long you should increase or decrease the bloom time. Generally speaking the courser your grind, the more time you will need to let it bloom. This is really the domain of experiementation. I don't increase the grind to get the shortest bloom time. I know some coffee shops do that. But I suggest experimentation. One to two minutes of bloom depending on your grind. But experiment, please. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is the freshness of your bean. Good coffee roasters cost a lot of money. Air roasters start at about $200 these days, and good drum roaster that roasts 1/2 pound to 2 pounds can cost as much as $1500.  That's a lot of money folks Does it make a huge difference in the flavor. Yes it does. It makes a huge difference to have fresh beans. In fact, it makes THE MOST difference provided you can store what you don't use that first day in a proper container.  You can get your brew method completely right, but if your coffee is not fresh, it may be smooth tasting but it will always be missing the unique and complex flavor it could otherwise have. In short, smooth but flat as a pancake no matter what your technique, water temperature, or equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3586" LastActivityDate="2016-12-12T12:09:33.333" CommentCount="2" />

In order to give a good overview, some background knowledge is useful. What all types of coffee have in common is that all are produced from the pits of coffee cherries, the fruits borne by trees in the genus coffea (coffee beans are technically seeds of these trees, not beans). Coffee cherries are harvested from coffee trees, the pits are removed and processed, producing green coffee beans. These are then roasted, ground, and brewed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can vary on any of the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bean Variety -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major bean varieties of coffee: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more ubiquitous and generally regarded as superior in quality to robusta coffees. If you are buying coffee from a coffee shop, ordering it at a restaurant, or brewing it at home, there is a very good chance you are drinking an arabica variety. Robusta is easier to grow and a less temperamental crop than arabica, contains quite a bit more caffeine, and generally is poorer quality than arabica. Robusta varieties are often used in instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Method -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major processing types for green coffee beans: washed and unwashed. Washed coffees remove the cherry before the bean is left to dry, while unwashed coffees have their beans removed from the cherries after drying. Unwashed coffees often come from Africa and Indonesia and have richer, earthier flavors, while washed coffees often come from Latin America, and are smoother and fruitier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Origin -&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most important factors, as coffee flavors vary greatly with geography, climate, and soil composition. For example, Ethopian coffees tend to be rich, full-bodied, and wine-like, Hawaiian coffees like Kona tend to be more acidic (flavor term, not pH), and Latin American coffees tend to be more medium bodied, fruity, and floral.&#xA;Roast - Roasting is a complex process that can produce varying degrees of flavor and caffeine content. Roasts levels can include light/half-city, medium/full-city, full (Viennese/Italian), and double (French), in order of increasing boldness. Contrary to popular opinion, lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than darker roasts. A good illustration of the process can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing method -&lt;/strong&gt; Can include drip filter, french press, percolated, espresso, or other methods. Brewing method also makes a big difference, with coffee aficionados generally preferring french press and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most expensive type of coffee is Kopi Luwak from Sumatra, Bali, Java, and Sulawesi. Kopi Luwak roughly translates to &quot;civet coffee&quot; in English, and is called such because the beans are harvested from the droppings of civets (a cat-like mammal from Indonesia). The beans are supposedly of superior quality because the civets choose only the ripest coffee beans to eat from coffee trees, and are processed in a unique way by the civets digestive tract. Kopi Luwak often sells for around $300/lb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following are the different types of coffee drinks that you may find in a cafe that prepares coffee using the espresso coffee making method:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affogato-&lt;/strong&gt; This is a term that literally means 'drowned'. It is the description of a shot of separately served espresso that is later poured over a the top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. This beverage is usually served in a short drink glass and is a Italian desert favourite. Popular Affogatos include Vanilla Affogato, Mocha Affogato, and Peppermint Affogato.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americano-&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as &quot;Lungo&quot; or &quot;Long Black&quot; and made by diluting 1-2 shots of espresso with hot water in order to approximate the texture, flavor and body of an American-style drip coffee.

Robusta is also more disease and pest-resistant than Arabica.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country of origin:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica coffee bean is produced primarily by Brazil, Columbia and Ethiopia, while Robusta is produced by Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia.&#xA;Un-roasted bean colour (above): In its un-roasted form, Arabica will be a darker shade of green, where Robusta tends to be more straw coloured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine content:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine content in Arabica ranges from 0.85 to 1.4%, while the caffeine content in Robusta ranges from 1.7% to 4.0%. So on average, Robusta has more than twice the caffeine content of Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemistry:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica has about 60% more lipids (fatty acids) than Robusta which plays a part in promoting Arabica’s overall superior cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visually:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica is elongated in shape while Robusta is round. Arabica is large in size while Robusta is small (half the size). Arabica is a flatter dome while Robusta is more like a bubble dome. Arabica has a variant underside crease while Robusta has a generally straight crease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica is typically traded at twice the price of Robusta due to Arabica’s lower plant yield, high labour intensity in farming and increased costs associated with crops grown at higher and on more difficult terrains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commerce:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica is the coffee bean that is purchased by cafes, while Robusta is the coffee bean that is typically used to make instant coffee, although the better grades of Robusta may be blended with Arabica in some cafe offers. The case for the humble Robusta coffee bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; Arabica produces a sweet-soft, mild and aromatic taste, with a smooth rich full-bodied pallet, while Robusta beans yield a harsher, bitter tasting cup often described as grain-like, oatmeal and woody. Where Arabica can produce a variety of taste notes including fruity, chocolaty and nutty, Robusta is just Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some ways to visually differentiate between the Arabica and Robusta coffee bean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule, in the roasted form:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica is oval in shape while Robusta is round&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica is large in size while Robusta is small (half the size)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica is a flatter dome while Robusta is more like a bubble dome.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica has a variant underside crease while Robusta has a generally straight crease.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zfg8o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zfg8o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3593" LastActivityDate="2016-12-13T12:36:21.633" CommentCount="2" />

The coffee tasted creamy with a buttery/oily after taste. You can taste both the coconut and butter. If you're used to drinking strong coffee with cream this is not that much of a stretch. The effect of the caffeine in the coffee does last longer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now let's talk about the effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bulletproof coffee or butter coffee was derived from the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_tea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Butter tea&lt;/a&gt; used in the Tibet and the Himalayas. In the region a higher caloric density Yak butter is used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MCT oil, which is also present in sufficient amounts in coconut oil (coconut oil also has higher amounts to HDL cholesterol to negligible LDL cholesterol, which is good) is an addition in tweaking the traditional butter tea to achive a Cognitive Enhancement. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;LDL&lt;/a&gt; is essential to repair and maintain the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Myelin&lt;/a&gt; sheath of neurons as such to good neural activity of the brain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MCT&lt;/a&gt; oil do not require energy for absorption, utilization, or storage. This means that MCT is generally considered a good biologically inert source of energy that the human body finds reasonably easy to metabolize. So in other words it provides a great energy boost with almost no fat storage. As such coconut oil constituting both, also metabolises into ketone bodies more efficiently than any other dietary substance, (Ketones may improve cognitive functioning) gives you a mental boot.

(Note: higher &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ketonema&lt;/a&gt; is achieved with low Carb intake, following through can give body a non starvation ketosis effect)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other effects of butter coffee is that it helps your body regulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; blood sugar levels and the hormone &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Leptin&lt;/a&gt; (hormone responsible for body fat regulation, metabolism, breaking down fact for energy rather than storing).

Personally I felt, Uh, no!!!  Drinking coffee (in general) is liable to give you more energy, which may help motivate you to be more active, but only assuming you don't already drink a lot of caffiene.

You could put a scale next to the hopper and if you feel like your espresso is running faster, check if the dose changed because the hopper is getting empty and adjust your grinder accordingly. I think checking the dose and grind occasionally throughout the day is a good way to up your espresso game in any case. It helps me learn a lot about the coffee and setup.

The amount of water you will need to add is therefore &lt;code&gt;11 x 25g = 275g&lt;/code&gt; to result in a total amount of 375g in your final cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the final answer by doing a reverse calculation. If the concentrate is 1:4 and you have 100g of it, it means you started with 25g of ground coffee. Therefore making a 1:15 ratio cup of coffee with 25g of coffee means &lt;code&gt;25g x 15 = 375g&lt;/code&gt; of water must be added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers align.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an amount of cold brew to be diluted, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;, which has a coffee-to-water ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:n&lt;/code&gt;, the amount of each part of water in the cold brew, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;c/n&lt;/code&gt;. The amount of water to be added to achieve a final ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:m&lt;/code&gt; is therefore &lt;code&gt;w x (m-n)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Units&lt;/em&gt; are any form of measure of the liquid mass being used, in g, mL or others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1702" LastEditorUserId="1702" LastEditDate="2017-01-11T09:50:20.040" LastActivityDate="2017-01-11T09:50:20.040" CommentCount="3" />

However, the differences you describe may be a symptom of the fact that there are big differences between instant coffee and your pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actual coffee. Your pour-over must be done with coffee grounds and so you are producing a cup of coffee freshly extracted from the grounds and subsequently freshly enjoyed. Not to mention the quality of the beans used might simply be of a higher quality than that used in instant coffee manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour-over. The brewing method itself is often known to produce much more nuanced flavours as it allows the brewer control of water flow as opposed to other automated brewers. This means that you can better extract the sugars and compounds that give coffee its aroma and flavour. Instant coffee is not fresh and the general manufacturing process is done en masse so the level of control that you would have to fine tune your cup of pour-over coffee will simply not be present in instant coffee. Also, due to the extra processes involved in freeze-drying and packaging the instant coffee, many flavourful compounds can be lost well before it reaches your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The factors noted above can change the resulting cup you enjoy and therefore change the amount of milk or sugar you will need in order for you to achieve your desired taste.

So it is impossible really to draw any specific conclusions without knowing how hot the water is and how long the extraction takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there are some general rules that always apply as the aforementioned slower extraction at lower temperatures. Another one is that with increasing contact time the extraction will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavor lower extractions are generally associated with more acidic/sour coffee and the higher the extraction the more of the bitter compounds will be in your cup. An ideal extraction will be balanced with some fruity acidity and some darker, chocolaty flavors. Since you are using a full immersion technique it will not make that much of a difference though. I imagine you wait a few minutes before you start drinking the coffee? So there's probably a short moment where the extraction is balanced but the longer you sip on your cup the more bitter it gets which means overextraction. I think time is the more relevant variable in your case (if my estimate of the temperature is more or less correct)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health wise I don't think it will make much of a difference either for the above mentioned reasons.

That would keep out the fines, but might lead to said increase of pressure (a Bialetti stove top has a pressure valve for security reasons, I've never seen it do it's job though).

Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and&#xA;  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it&#xA;  releases even more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use&#xA;  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.&#xA;  Moderation in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3795" LastEditorUserId="3813" LastEditDate="2017-02-02T16:38:14.497" LastActivityDate="2017-02-03T15:33:21.963" Title="What is a café allongé, and how is it pronounced?"

If you are using them as vessel-recipients of water from an automated dripper, it will not produce the kind of cup you desire due to the randomness at which it applies water over the bed of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing pour-over, there are a few major parameters that you will have to control to produce clean cups. Note that you will require a gooseneck kettle in order to have proper control over the water flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind. Ensure that you are using a burr grinder that is of decent quality, meaning that it can grind to a good consistency with a low number of fines. Fines are smaller granules of coffee produced in the grinding process as the beans are crushed and can over-extract to bring out bitter flavours. Your grind size should also be of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kuissential.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04-Intro2B.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water Temperature. This is one of the most important factors of the bunch for pour-over brewing in my experience. It's the parameter that you will change to fine tune how many compounds are being dissolved as you brew once you have a grind size that is in the right ball park. You should experiment with this as it will depend on the grind size and dose you use but I like to keep it at around 90 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agitation. This measures how much you move and disturb the coffee. The more you agitate it by pouring, the more you continuously expose the coffee grounds to the water and encourage extraction. Controlling this will be another experimental variable for your specific parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the above three that I believe to be the most important factors in what makes a clean pour-over brew, you should also take into account, the brew time, coffee-to-water ratio, coffee dose and obviously coffee origin and freshness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1702" LastActivityDate="2017-02-03T15:39:14.467" CommentCount="2" />

These are all quite different things and while unclean, earthy and murky are definitely not things you want in your coffee, brightness is usually a desirable attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A clean cup of of coffee is characterized by the absence of unwanted flavors, that often result from defects in the beans (which would correspond to your earthy description). A lot of people though incorrectly use it to describe the absence of fines in your cup (which would be the murky part). So in this sense a cleaner cup than what you get with a Chemex is almost impossible. Thus I guess you are actually talking about earthy flavors, which are in fact defects. Those flavors you will most likely not get out of your coffee, since they arise not due to a wrong extraction. Your extraction might be perfect, but because of defective beans it will still taste earthy. These flavors are common in badly processed coffees (dried on actual dirt or mold during the drying process for example). However a balanced extraction might minimize the presence of these flavors in the profile, since other flavors might be more dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brightness is as I've said usually a desirable attribute in coffee, it refers to a nice, fresh flavor and acidity. So I'm not quite sure what you mean with it, maybe you could clarify on that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you indeed talk about acidity then I guess your coffee could be underextracted (more info on how you extract would be helpful as well) or the roast is underdeveloped. Underdevelopment could also bring some grassy, herbal like flavors in your coffee that might be mistaken for earthy flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either case it seems to be the coffee and not your extraction, but without more info it's difficult to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1397" LastActivityDate="2017-02-03T22:44:04.970" CommentCount="0" />

Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First: Source your coffee!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My preference is very fresh, bright, fruity blends direct from a roaster or coffee house; a reputable barista &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have a suggestion of which one makes a good cold brew. I strongly advise against cold brewing grocery store coffee as the resulting flavor will not be worth the effort, even when buying the more expensive, grind-it-yourself coffee. It's not fresh enough!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grind should be slightly coarser than what would be used for a regular drip coffee maker and generally your barista will gladly grind for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most important:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use a 1:1 ratio, ounces coffee :: cups water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 ounce coffee : 1 cup water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;4 ounces coffee : 4 cups / 1 quart water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;12 ounces coffee : 12 cups / 3 quarts of water*&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;16 ounces coffee : 16 cups / 4 quarts / 1 gallon water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*This is my most common ratio; I consistently get 11 cups of concentrate from 12 cups of water. This results in about 11 pints of coffee when mixed as directed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Large container in which to brew. Make sure you can cover the container to keep out contaminants. A pitcher or carafe with lid is ideal, and a wide-mouth will help with cleanup and removal of the used grounds. My preference is glass but plastic may be adequate. Previously I had recommended the Bormioli Rocco Airtight Jar in 5 liter capacity but have found that it isn’t ideal when brewing with a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) A sieve, bag, or both to strain the mixture after brewing and before filtering. A nut-milk bag is especially useful - I've been using one to brew and it has made the filtering process quite a lot quicker, cleaner, and easier than filtering with a sieve alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) A fine filter to remove the smaller silt from the mixture. A regular paper coffee filter is the perfect tool for this step, naturally, and you can use the sieve mentioned above to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measure out coffee and water separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're using a bag to brew, place the bag in to the container, then fill the bag with the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not using a bag, simply put the coffee in to the container.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slowly pour the water over the coffee to soak the grounds completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Close up your container for about 10 minutes in order to allow for the coffee grounds to become saturated through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not using a bag, you'll notice all the grounds at the top of the mixture at the end of the waiting period; if you are using a bag you probably won't notice any difference. In either case, use a non-metal (wooden or plastic) spoon or spatula to submerge the grounds in to the mixture. If you're using the bag, treat it like a teabag and simply dunk it repeatedly. If you're not using a bag, you can mix vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow to brew for 24 hours at room temperature. Periodically you may wish to agitate the mixture as the grounds may sink to the bottom if you're not using a bag, and we want to maximize the coffee grounds contact with the water in order to maximize the flavor extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 24 hours, strain &amp;amp; filter out coffee grains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bag method:&#xA; - Remove bag&#xA; - Empty grounds in to bin and rinse bag&#xA; - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage container&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sieve method:&#xA; - Pour mixture slowly through sieve in to intermediate container&#xA; - Empty sieve as necessary through process&#xA; - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage container&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strained mixture will be a concentrated brew of the most delicious nectar of nature.

In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.&#xA;Hope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways.

Because of this it’s easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have a web page &lt;a href=&quot;http://aerobie.com/aeropress/aeropress-vs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;comparing AeroPress&lt;/a&gt; with French Press and other kinds of coffee makers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;French presses use coarsely ground coffee because of the size of the holes in their filters. The coarsely ground coffee particles have less surface area than finely ground coffee. The lower surface area necessitates a long steeping time to extract full coffee flavor. Unfortunately, this results in bitterness and acidity in the cup. The AeroPress uses espresso or fine-drip grind coffee with a big surface area to quickly extract rich, full flavor without bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The coarsely ground coffee required by French press filters unfortunately includes some small particles which pass through the filter and into your cup. These particles continue to leach bitterness leading to a harsh, gritty brew. AeroPress brewed coffee is micro filtered so it is pure and particle free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;French presses cannot produce espresso style coffee and therefore the drinks that can be made with it. The AeroPress can produce regular American style coffee or an espresso style concentrate which can be used like espresso in espresso based drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;All ground coffee contains the molecules cafestol and kahweol, two molecules which raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. The metal filters in French presses do not filter out cafestol and kahweol. The AeroPress’s paper filters do remove them, meaning that AeroPress brewed coffee is free of these harmful elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;French presses are notoriously difficult to clean. The AeroPress is essentially self cleaning, requiring only a quick rinse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you use a Baratza grinder, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baratza.com/grinding-tips/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for their recommended grind sizes.

You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aerate the milk by keeping the tip of the steam wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear spitting noises. This will introduce air into the milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you have aerated enough, dip the tip of the steam wand below the surface and try to form a vortex/whirlpool.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spin the milk as in step 2 until the milk is at the right temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1702" LastActivityDate="2017-02-13T14:55:54.493" CommentCount="2" />

The water is not very close to boiling temperatures. You wait for a while to brew it. At the end, the output is coffee with some fine residue of coffee ground in it.

So, it must be consumed fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual pour-over&lt;/strong&gt;: Coffee and water are in two different compartments.

If you're grinding with just a basic blade grinder, your grounds are extremely inconsistent. Regardless of your brewing method, your result will be quite different from the results of a grinder with better consistency. The reason has to do with the amount of extraction happening over [time] in relation to the coffee's surface area. If the grounds are large, the surface area is less, so the total extraction per [time] is less. If the grounds are very fine, the surface area is greater, so the total extraction per [time] becomes greater. When your grounds are consistent, you can prepare coffee with greater accuracy. However, if some of your grounds are huge, others medium and others fine, then you have very little control over accuracy, and you sort of have to choose between under-extraction for watery results with less undesirables, or over-extraction for fuller results with more undesirables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using a blade grinder, I recommend over-grinding for more consistent results. Then just shorten your brew time in order to not over-extract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the event that you're using a pretty decent grinder, then how coarse/fine you're grinding the coffee is probably the second most influential aspect. If your grounds are fine, then more grounds are likely to pass through the plunger, and you'll also have to put more force on the plunger, possibly pushing even more grounds through. The more grounds that pass through lengthen the total extraction, even after you pour it out. To be honest, this usually makes a small difference that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people cannot detect it, and those who can do not often care. So relatively speaking, in this case the pour-over may be considered the better option. However, if you're grinder can produce evenly coarse grounds, with little to no powder, then the french press is an equally good method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is a notable difference in the flavor between the two. It is said that the coffee from a french-press &quot;clogs&quot; your taste buds. And most people can taste the cleaner/thinner quality of coffee that's been filtered through paper. But at the end of the day, it's preference. I have a coffee snob friend who only drinks french press, and another who only drinks pour-over.

Washed Ethiopian coffees or Central American coffees work best in my opinion. I prefer washed, but natural works as well. With natural coffees cold brew will usually bring out the red berry flavors even more and sometimes it can be too much in my opinion.

How long you should optimally warm up depends on your container material, of course - a thick mug warmed up long enough will retain heat for a long, good time :) Thin porcelain doesn't need long warming, obviously.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You can also warm up the cup by microwaving it with a little water inside (be careful not to have the water evaporate/ overheat the cup), but I've found microwaves often don't heat up uniformly...  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.s.: When getting rid of the warm water, you can first pour it through your empty coffee dripper, so &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is also warmed up (no need for extra water on that, it's thin metal with little heat resistance, anyways, so pouring through warm water will most likely do the trick)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4110" LastEditorUserId="4110" LastEditDate="2017-04-01T13:30:44.860" LastActivityDate="2017-04-01T13:30:44.860" CommentCount="0" />

French Press tends to lend additional body and heaviness to a cup of coffee. This is predominantly due to the fact that the water is in extended contact with the grounds (4-5 minutes) which allows less soluble molecules to extract from the grounds.  These less soluble molecules tend to have higher atomic weight, which lends a heavier mouthfeel (Modulating the Roast touches on this).  Additionally, french press doesn't filter out fines.  This adds body, but also muddles lighter flavors in the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are after a cleaner more defined cup of coffee, then I would point you to pour over or even a high quality drip brewer (Bonavita makes great coffee imo).

The brewing chambers were simplistic, but the biggest downside was lack of accurate temperature control.

Newer drip brewers rely on updated electronics that can accurately keep the water temperature in this narrow range which is going to give you improved coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the shower head at the top of the brew chamber.  Does it pour the water down in a single stream, or does it distribute the water nicely across the grounds?  This makes a difference in brew quality and on newer machines, more thought has gone into this design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pump rate -- if you read up on how people do pour over, a lot of focus is on timing.  Allowing the coffee to bloom, then proper water per minute rates must be adhered to.  All of these details will change the flavor of the coffee.  Newer machines again have better control over these variables due to improved electronics which allow them to produce more consistent, and hopefully better coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thermal Carafe -- I just had to throw this in here; these machines brew into an insulated carafe rather than a non-insulated carafe with heater underneath.

I also read a post elsewhere from a person who says she bought a single-cup coffee filter holder with three holes at the bottom rather than the typical one hole, and that the coffee tasted better because the water drained more quickly. Does the faster the coffee passes through a filter make it less bitter? If so, I wonder why the three hole filter holder isn't more sold more frequently.

There are a couple of other links to coffee bitterness in that question also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping other major factors constant (e.g., same temperature of water, same beans), &lt;em&gt;time and grind level&lt;/em&gt; are the easiest to modify to reduce bitterness. That is: &lt;strong&gt;shorter time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coarser grind&lt;/strong&gt; will (generally) result in less bitter coffee. While you certainly can't expect to get a reasonable brew from barely chopped beans in 15 seconds, small changes in time and grind level can have a noticeable impact on outcomes, especially for immersion-style brewing methods like French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and to a lesser extent stovetop methods like percolator or moka.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifics vary by brewing method. For instance, some bitter-tasting compounds are filtered out by paper filters, so paper-filter pour-over will generally be less bitter than French press, for example. Also, your average paper filter will allow brewed coffee to filter more quickly with a coarser grind (finer grinds will more quickly clog the filter) so you might have to vary your pouring method to keep the total brewing time constant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy trying to vary one parameter at a time: trying coarser- or finer-grind coffee, then with a shorter or longer period of time, in both cases trying to vary only one parameter at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:53.733" LastActivityDate="2017-04-08T19:27:53.233" CommentCount="1" />

Moka Pots are almost more similar to an espresso brewing method than a french press or a pour over system.  Water very near boiling is forced through a coffee puck at some level of increased pressure which brews your coffee.  Just looking at the mechanical system that is being used, it appears to me that if you were to leave the pot on the stove just slightly longer than intended, your coffee would brew with a higher temp water, at higher pressure.  Both of these can cause bitterness.  I think the comment stating that increased time on the stove = more bitter coffee doesn't have to do with brew times, but rather, has to do with water temp and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of what you are asking comes down to the chemistry of the molecules in the coffee grounds.  When water is applied to the coffee grounds, the first compounds to extract are citric and malic acids followed by more complex (and less soluble compounds).  The compounds which contribute heavy body tend to have high atomic weight, and are not very soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presuming your grind, water temp, ratios etc are all the same, then the longer you steep the coffee grounds in water, the more body will be contributed to the final extraction, while a very fast extraction will contribute lots of brightness and acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;French press is on the far end of the spectrum for brew times, so the resultant coffee has lots of body, but the lighter flavors tend to be muddled, and the acidity seems blunted.  An additional factor on the french press is that the filters are all in all pretty poor, so you end up with lots of fines in your cup of coffee.  Fines are not dissolved solids, and don't really contribute to anything but mouth feel.  They might lend a bit of body, but really, they leave that nasty last sip of grounds in the bottom of your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically drip / pour over are a bit more balanced.  They filter fines, and brew time (ie water contact with grounds, not necessarily total brew time) is shorter, which contributes to a 'cleaner' cup of coffee where the acid and finer notes can be easily perceived, and the body doesn't completely take over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4114" LastActivityDate="2017-04-10T17:04:49.857" CommentCount="1" />

It's almost impossible to find your answer because of how many different variables are at play here. You should first focus on minimising the variance in your methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You describe the shop shot as being a 'longer pull' and thereby expecting more bitter results. The problem with that assumption is that you can only truly compare shot times if you have extracted the same output weight in both cases. Since you have not, you have not only extracted much less in your shop shot, but, like you noted, it also took longer. I normally only ever measure my shots by weight because that's the number that tells me how much water got through and thereby how much real contact and subsequent extraction occurred.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I use time as a secondary reference to diagnose other problems in my shot. If I suddenly start extracting a same weight shot in half the time that I normally do, I know something is definitely off. Since your shop shot extracted much less output weight, the sourness is clearly due to some level of underextraction from being stopped too early (relative to your home shot). In any case, I always try to aim for 30g in 30s, which means you probably need to grind slightly finer in the shop to be able to extract more and try to hit the same balance as your home shot.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You mention your water sources being different. This is huge! You will never find the same shot if you are using filtered at home and unfiltered at the shop depending on how hard the water is when unfiltered.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare shot times as a secondary to consistent output weight and see how grinding finer in the shop would fare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher boiler pressure does not necessarily point directly towards higher temperatures. Also, higher pressures could impact the puck suddenly when the valve is opened which could crack and cause channeling and therefore underextraction and sourness. Your main issues here are still in point 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight difference is purely by choice. Crema production is mostly dependent on freshness of beans and less to do with specifics in extraction method. If preset weight quantities are being used as part of a single button-press on a machine, then your problem starts there. You need to weigh every shot and choose when to stop the shot yourself. Without this control, you're simply relinquishing responsibility of the shot and you are at the mercy of the machine, yet another variable to consider in being able to find the right shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you MUST minimise variables. Make sure your grind sizes are the same at both locations, ensure your input and output weight are identical, analyse differences in taste and extraction time at same output weight, ensure your sources of water are identical, make sure your tamp pressures are the same. At this point the only real differences will be the machines and then you can start investigating how each machine is affecting the shots. Try to use bottomless portafilters in order to diagnose whether your distribution of your coffee bed was poor and whether channeling occurs during extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combine all of the parameters above with the taste of your output shots and you'll know the next steps you need to take in finding the problem in your shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1702" LastEditorUserId="1702" LastEditDate="2017-05-02T13:45:09.893" LastActivityDate="2017-05-02T13:45:09.893" CommentCount="12" />

Fair trade provides a baseline above the commodities rates, but they don't ensure that the farmer is getting the most for their product.  Furthermore, the farm has to be able to be certified for conforming to certain environmental conditions prior to being certified.  Many coffee farmers are so far off the beaten path that they simply cannot afford to be certified.  I believe that conscientious importers provide a far better compensation to the farmer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like Fair Trade assures something between 15 and 35 cents above commodities rates.  This is far below what a roaster will pay for specialty grade coffee.  While fair trade is a good baseline, if you purchase specialty coffee, you are most likely buying coffee that was purchased for significantly better than fair trade rates.  To give you an idea.. I pulled up a random invoice I had in my inbox and it was $1.70 above commodities rate.  Furthermore, importers provide on the ground support to farmers in the form of varietal education and recommendations, disease prevention, washing technique improvements, all of which net the farmer tangible benefits because their coffee will improve in quality, and thus, sell for more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So.. if you are looking for good ethical compensation for farmers, I would say look for local specialty roasteries.  These roasteries are purchasing high quality coffee from a high quality importer which means that there are people on the ground helping farmers achieve better quality, and thus better compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The link below is a pretty interesting article from a greens buyer I am thinking about working with.

You can pop the top bit off the grinder (The black&#xA;  plastic part) and unscrew the worm-drive mounting.

Also could be that one if the screws has come loose so the&#xA;  blde is loose on its mount. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hold the button down that holds the step ring and unscrew the ring.&#xA;  This will leave you with the plastic ring and an cast alu mount for&#xA;  the top blade. Use a wire brush and clean this blade. Remove it and&#xA;  clean the mount, put it back. Next remove the lower blade. To do this&#xA;  safely unplug from the mains. To stop the motor turning while you&#xA;  unscrew place a large flat blade driver next to one of the fins. Clean&#xA;  it all and put it all back together. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Next set the grind to the right courseness. Dose a little onto your&#xA;  hand and rub the grouds with your figer.

I've done a lot of research on caffeine levels or at least reading various books that skirt the topic.  Interestingly, the caffeine amount in a particular roast is slightly different than most peoples conceptions, including my own up until a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, caffeine levels in dark vs light roasts are often said to be different.  From a chemical perspective caffeine is chemically stable to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (it's melting point).  Due to this, caffeine is not removed during the roasting process unless you are roasting to a Spanish roast, or burned beyond all recognition.  As such, the caffeine inherit in a particular lot of green coffee tends to stay the same amount per bean regardless of roast depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The twist..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roasting will roughly double bean size, and burn off between 12 and 18% of the total weight of a bean.  Due to this, technically, a darker roast has more caffeine by weight than a lighter roast, which is opposite of what I hear a lot of people say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now.. on to your question.. If the pods are by weight, I suppose a dark roast will have marginally more caffeine.  Where you get a significant difference in caffeine amounts is when you start looking at different types of coffee.  Robusta coffees for instance tend to be low grown and have adapted to the environment by having higher concentrations of caffeine.  The reason is simply that caffeine is the coffee plants natural pesticide.  That being said, Robusta coffees also tend to be very bitter, hence why they are predominantly used in cheap coffee blends in place of arabica.  The bitterness is directly related to the elevated caffeine, as well as very high concentrations of CGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is pick what tastes good, because honestly, you aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of caffeine per roast, or lot of beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4114" LastActivityDate="2017-05-23T23:14:31.840" CommentCount="0" />

The higher quality the grinder, the most consistently the coffee grounds will conform to those two sizes.  One size is the actual grind level, dictated in a burr grinder, by the burr design and how closely they are put together.  The other particle size are the tiny fragments that break off when you fracture two pieces of bean to make the larger particles.  These smaller particles are called 'fines'.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While you will find fines in every grind level, I believe you get more fines the finer you grind.  Just thinking logically, if you take a bean and break it one time, then you will get x amount of fines.  Break it twice and you get more, etc etc.  Effectively grinding finer, will cause more breaks in the coffee bean, releasing more fines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fines tend to slip through the metal mesh of a french press very easily, which is part of the reason the coffee has a heavier mouth feel, as well as muddled high notes.  All that being said, I can't say I have often found a coating of fines high in the cup, rather they tend to sit in the bottom.  This indicates either a huge amount of fines, or as some others have indicated, maybe some crazy combination of oil slick suspending fines?  Recommend reviewing your grind level.  Do you have heavy grinds in the bottom of your cup? If so, you may need to grind more coarse.  French press should be ground at a very coarse setting to help prevent this.  By the look of that cup, I would guess that you may be able to swipe your finger around the edge of the cup to capture all of that stain, and feel some grit between your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you are using pre-ground coffee, almost 100% guarantee the grind level is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4114" LastActivityDate="2017-05-30T16:33:27.900" CommentCount="0" />

How I came up with the adjustment was because at the time I had my home grinder configured for french press and was using it daily, and I simply did a comparison of grind levels until the adjustment appeared to be the same size.  Given a normalized 11 setting, everything else should match up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first purchased my EK43, I felt that it did not allow coarse enough grinding to get to French press level grinds.  I pulled the tap screws on the grind adjustment knob and and loosened the burrs equivalent of 2 grind units (effectively making grind level 3 originally a 1).  This adjusted the grinder such that an 11 was a French press grind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once this is configured, and presuming you are using the 'new' EK43 burrs, I use the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;11 - French Press and cupping samples&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.5-8 - Drip brew and Keurig depending on desired strength.  This setting will also work with Bunn brewers IF the user uses the proper amount of grounds, which almost no one does..

I wish I could just tell them to double the amount of coffee they put in the machine but.. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup is basically useless for espresso grinding.

At this ratio, you should be getting very strong coffee from a pour over system, and in general it should not be sour.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you are describing sounds like under extraction.  This could be caused by a number of things.  I will focus on the pour over system for now and outline possible issues below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water not hot enough:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  It sounds like your method is pretty good for this, but if you are getting sour/very bright flavors, then it is a possible culprit.  Lower temp water will extract fewer compounds per second than higher temp water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grind level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a high likelyhood, and if a coffee doesn't taste right, this is the first thing I adjust.  For pour over, you should be doing a medium to medium fine grind.  Each person / coffee is going to adjust slightly differently but if you are getting sour / too bright, grind finer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pour speed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Pour over can be a bit of an art with the concentric circles etc.  You should be keeping the grounds saturated without having standing water above the grounds.  Pour too fast, and you will under extract.  Typically to brew about 400ml of extract, I spent 5-6 minutes pouring, maybe a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amount of grounds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  You may want to increase the amount of coffee per cup.  As I mentioned, with the coffee I produce, you should be getting a very bold cup of coffee at 9g / 120g water.  I typically tone this down and do maybe 24g for 360g extract?  It still comes out very strong.  If you make all of the above adjustments and still get weak / sour / bright coffee, start adding more grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your French press is brewing bright, then I would look to water.  French press grind is as coarse as most grinders go, and is very forgiving on extraction.  If you are getting bright / sour coffee in the press, make sure you are allowing it to steep for a good 4-5 minutes, make sure your water is just off boil, and make sure you are using enough grounds.  Again, start with about 8-9g per cup and adjust from there.  Personally I use 7 'scoops' which end up being about 8g each for an 8 cup french press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just 2 cents of advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If you are just looking for a good cup of coffee in the morning, I would recommend simple.

I opt for porcelain as it may also help keeping the coffee warm as its thermal conductivity is less than gold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the three you mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wooden: Sometimes I taste it.

Some of these things are really of bad quality and I am suspicious if their thermal resistance is adequate for coffee. I wouldn't prefer them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal: Especially, if you mention polished 18/10 stainless steel cutlery, they probably resist the heat and won't react with anything. So, the only bad thing about them is, they may make your cup colder a bit quicker than usual. Just take the spoon off right after use. This would be my preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1848" LastActivityDate="2017-06-08T17:13:16.680" CommentCount="0" />

As a rule of thumb, temperature lowers as elevation increases but at higher altitudes other flavour qualities are lost. Your best bet is finding places where altitude is not too high but climate conditions provide cooler climates. In Colombia, coffees from Nariño; Filandia, Risaralda or Oiba, Santander tend to be very sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colombiancoffeehub.com/colcoffeehub/lecture-how-are-sugars-in-coffee-p_1467410&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://colombiancoffeehub.com/colcoffeehub/lecture-how-are-sugars-in-coffee-p_1467410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4385" LastActivityDate="2017-06-08T22:02:27.597" CommentCount="0" />

Lower elevation also typically signifies higher caffeine which is very bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for light roasts with mild acidity.  Why light roasts?  Coffee beans coloration comes from Maillard reactions, a key component of which is sugar caramelization. While in your mind, caramel is sweet, raw sugar (sucrose for instance) is significantly more sweet than caramelized sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why low acidity?  While acidity isn't bad in a coffee, I feel like if you are trying to optimize sweetness, acidity detracts from perceived sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's really difficult to say what origin is most sweet, but it may be a better approach to say what origins have flavor components that might help add to a perceived sweetness.  For me, I like a good Guatemalan or Ethiopian for a clean, brisk sweet cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other note.. Espresso roasts 'should' be optimized to minimize acidity and bitterness while maintaining as much sweetness as possible.  You may find some espresso beans that will fit the bill for sweetness, but I still think you can find more sweet coffees at lower roast levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4114" LastActivityDate="2017-06-09T22:09:33.500" CommentCount="0" />
